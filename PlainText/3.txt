Riemannian metrics
 Riemannian geometry considers manifolds with the additional structure of a Riemannian metric  a type positive definite symmetric tensor field  To a first order approximation this means that a Riemannian manifold is a Euclidean space  we can measure lengths of vectors and angles between them  Immediately we can define the length of curves by the usual integral  and then the distance between points comes from the glb of lengths of curves  Thus  Riemannian manifolds become metric spaces in the topological sense  Riemannian geometry is a subject of current mathematical research in itself  We will try to give some of the flavor of the questions being considered now and then in these notes  A Riemannian structure is also frequently used as a tool for the study of other properties of manifolds  For example  if we are given a second order linear elliptic partial differential operator  then the second-order coefficients of that operator form a Riemannian metric and it is natural to ask what the general properties of that metric tell us about the partial differential equations involving that operator  Conversely  on a Riemannian manifold there is singled out naturally such an operator  the Laplace-Beltrami  Laplace-Beltrami  operator   so that it makes sense  for example  to talk about solving the heat equation  heat equation  on a Riemannian manifold  The Riemannian metrics have nice properties not shared by just any topological metrics  so that in topological studies they are also used as a tool for the study of manifolds  The generalization of Riemannian geometry to the case where the metric is not assumed to be positive definite  but merely nondegenerate  forms the basis for general relativity theory  general relativity   We will not go very far in that direction  but some of the major theorems and concepts are identical in the generalization  We will be careful to point out which theorems we can prove in this more general setting  For a deeper study there is a fine book  O Neill  O Neill  B    Semi-Riemannian geometry  Academic Press  1983  I recommend this book also for its concise summary of the theory of manifolds  tensors  and Riemannian geometry itself  The first substantial question we take up is the existence of Riemannian metrics  It is interesting that we can immediately use Riemannian metrics as a tool to shed some light on the existence of semi-Riemannian metrics of nontrivial index   Existence of Riemannian metrics   Riemannian metrics  On any smooth manifold there exists a Riemannian metric  The key idea of the proof is that locally we always have Riemannian metrics carried over from the standard one on Cartesian space by coordinate mappings  and we can glue them together smoothly with a partition of unity  partition of unity   In the gluing process the property of being positive definite is preserved due to the convexity of the set of positive definite symmetric matrices  What happens for indefinite metrics  The set of nonsingular symmetric matrices of a given index is   not  convex  so that the existence proof breaks down  In fact  there is a condition on the manifold  which can be reduced to topological invariants  in order that a semi-Riemannian metric of index exist  there must be a subbundle of the tangent bundle of rank  When the structure is called a   Lorentz   structure  Lorentz structure   that is the case of interest in general relativity theory  the topological condition for a compact manifold to have a Lorentz structure is easily understood  the Euler characteristic  Euler characteristic  must be  The proof in the Lorentz case can be done by using the fact that for any simple curve there is a diffeomorphism which is the identity outside any given neighborhood of the curve and which moves one end of the curve to the other  In the compact case start with a vector field having discrete singularities  Then by choosing disjoint simple curves from these singularities to inside a fixed ball  we can obtain a diffeomorphism which moves all of them inside that ball  If the Euler characteristic is then by the Hopf index theorem  Hopf index theorem   the index of the vector field on the boundary of the ball is so the vector field can be extended to a nonsingular vector field inside the ball  Conversely  by the following Theorem thm metricsexist a Lorentz metric would give a nonsingular rank subbundle  If that field is nonorientable  pass to the double covering for which the lift of it is orientable  Then there is a nonsingular vector field which is a global basis of the line field  so the Euler characteristic is   Euler characteristic Lorentz manifold   orientable  In the noncompact case  take a countable exhaustion of the manifold by an increasing family of compact sets  Then the singularities of a vector field can be pushed outside each of the compact sets sequentially  leaving a nonsingular vector field on the whole in the limit  Thus  every noncompact  separable  manifold has a Lorentz structure   Existence of semi-Riemannian metrics   semi-Riemannian metric  A smooth manifold has a semi-Riemannian metric of index if and only if there is a subbundle of the tangent bundle of rank  The idea of the proof is  the subbundle will be the directions in which the semi-Riemannian metrics will be negative definite  If we change the sign on the subbundle and leave it unchanged on the orthogonal complement  we will get a Riemannian metric  The construction goes both ways  Although the idea for the proof of Theorem thm metricsexist is correct  there are some nontrivial technical difficulties to entertain us  One direction is relatively easy    Proof of   if   part  If has a smooth tangent subbundle of rank then has a semi-Riemannian metric of index  A   frame  at a point of a semi-Riemannian manifold is a basis of the tangent space with respect to which the component matrix of the metric tensor is diagonal with  s followed by 1 s on the diagonal  A   local frame field  is a local basis of vector fields which is a frame at each point of its domain   Technical Lemma 1  Local frames exist in a neighborhood of every point   frame field local  TL 1 is important for other purposes than the proof of the theorem at hand  For the proof of TL 1 one modifies the Gramm-Schmidt procedure  starting with a smooth local basis and shrinking the domain at each step if necessary to divide by the length for normalization  If we write then a local frame is exactly one for which the coframe of -forms satisfies  coframe  The Gramm-Schmidt  Gramm-Schmidt procedure procedure amounts to iterated completion of squares  viewing as a homogeneous quadratic polynomial in the  The modifications needed to handle the negative signs are probably easier in this form   Technical Lemma 2  If is a smooth tangent subbundle of rank and is a Riemannian metric  then the tensor field and the semi-Riemannian metric given as follows are smooth   Their expressions in terms of smooth local frames   adapted to V  for are   constant   hence smooth   Now the converse    Proof of  only if   part  If there is a semi-Riemannian metric of index then there is a tangent subbundle of rank  The outline of the proof goes as follows  Take a Riemannian metric  Then and are related by a tensor field as above  We know that is symmetric with respect to -frames  and has negative eigenvalues  counting multiplicities  at each point  Thus  the subspace spanned by the eigenvectors of these negative eigenvalues at each point is -dimensional  The claim is that those subspaces form a smooth subbundle  even though it may be impossible to choose the individual eigenvectors to form smooth vector fields   Technical Lemma 3  If is a symmetric linear operator  smoothly dependent on coordinates and is a simple eigenvalue at the origin  then extends to a smooth simple eigenvalue function in a neighborhood of the origin having a smooth eigenvector field  Let  Use the implicit function theorem to solve getting  Then we can write and any nonzero column of is an eigenvector  by the Cayley-Hamilton theorem   Cayley-Hamilton theorem   Technical Lemma 4  Suppose that is a smooth function with decomposable  nonzero values  Then locally there are smooth vector fields having wedge product equal to  For the interior product is always in the subspace carried by  Choose of these  s which give linearly independent interior products with at one point  then they do so locally   Technical Lemma 5  If is a symmetric linear operator of index smoothly dependent on coordinates then the extension of to a   derivation  of the Grassmann algebra  Grassmann algebra  has a unique minimum simple eigenvalue on  The  smooth   eigenvectors are decomposable  Generalize the result of TL s 3  4  5  If there is a group of eigenvalues of which always satisfy then the subspace spanned by their eigenvectors is smooth   Consider  Can be continuous functions of too   Now order   all  of the eigenvalues of symmetric smooth defining uniquely functions of  Prove that the are continuous  on the subset where is smooth and has locally smooth eigenvector fields  Construct an example for which and neither nor their eigenvector fields are smooth in a neighborhood of  I have had to referee and reject two papers because the proofs were based on the assumption that eigenvector fields could be chosen smoothly  Take care  Hard Problem  In Problem prob3 can it be arranged so that there is no smooth eigenvector field on the set where   If that set is simply connected  then there is a smooth vector field  and in any case there is always a smooth subbundle of rank 1  However  in the non-simply-connected case  the subbundle may be disoriented in passing around some loop 
Finsler Metrics
  Finsler metric Let be as continuous function which is positive on nonzero vectors and is   positive homogeneous of degree 1   Eventually we should also assume that the   unit balls   that is the subsets of the tangent spaces on which are convex  but that property is not required to give the initial facts we want to look at here  In fact  it is usually assumed that is smooth and that its restriction to each tangent space has positive definite second derivative matrix  the   Hessian  of  with respect to linear coordinates on that tangent space  This implies that the unit balls are strictly convex and smooth  A function satisfying these conditions is called a   Finsler metric  on M  If is a Riemannian metric on M  then there is a corresponding Finsler metric  given by the norm with respect to    We use the letter because it is treated like a Lagrangian in mechanics  Finsler metrics were systematically studied by P  Finsler starting about 1918   Finsler  P 
Length of Curves
 For a piecewise curve we define  length  the   length  of to be The reason for assuming that is positive homogeneous is that it makes the length of a curve independent of its parametrization  This follows easily from the change of variable formula for integrals  Length is clearly additive with respect to chaining of curves end-to-end  Not every Finsler metric comes from a Riemannian metric  The condition for that to be true is the   parallelogram law   parallelogram law   well-known to functional analysts   Characterization of Riemannian Finsler Metrics  A Finsler metric is the Finsler metric of a Riemannian metric g if and only if it satisfies the parallelogram law  for all tangent vectors at all points of  When this law is satisfied  the Riemannian metric can be recovered from by the   polarization identity      polarization
Distance
  distance  When we have a notion of lengths of curves satisfying the additivity with respect to chaining curves end-to-end  as we do when we have a Finsler metric  then we can define the   intrinsic metric   the word metric is used here as it is in topology  a distance function  by specifying the   distance from p to q  to be  metric intrinsic  Generally this function is only a semi-metric  in that we could have but not The symmetry and the triangle inequality are rather easy consequences of the definition  but the nondegeneracy in the case of Finsler lengths of curves is nontrivial   Topological Equivalence Theorem  If is the intrinsic metric coming from a Finsler metric  then is a topological metric on and the topology given by is the same as the manifold topology   topology of Finsler manifold  If is not connected  then the definition gives when and are not in the same connected components  We simply allow such a value for it is a reasonable extension of the notion of a topological metric   Nondegeneracy Lemma  If is a coordinate map  where is a   compact  subset of then there are positive constant such that for every curve in Here is the standard Euclidean length of The key step in the proof is to observe that the union of the unit  with respect to the Euclidean coordinate metric  spheres at points of forms a   compact  subset of the tangent bundle  Since is positive on nonzero vectors and continuous on on we have a positive minimum and a finite maximum for on  The result breaks down on infinite-dimensional manifolds modeled on a Banach space   Banach space  because there the set of unit vectors will not be compact  So in that case the inequalities and must be taken as a local hypothesis on  The nondegeneracy of uses the lemma in an obvious way  although there is a subtlety that could be overlooked  the nondegeneracy of the intrinsic metric on defined by the standard Euclidean metric must be proved independently  Aside from the Hausdorff separation axiom   Hausdorff separation axiom  the topology of a manifold is determined as a local property by the coordinate maps on compact subsets  Since the nondegeneracy lemma tells us that there is nesting of d-balls and coordinate-balls  the topologies must coincide  Prove that the intrinsic metric on defined by the standard Euclidean metric is nondegenerate  and  in fact  coincides with the usual distance formula  Hint  For a curve from to split the tangent vector into components parallel to and perpendicular to  The integral of the parallel component is always at least the usual distance 
Length of a curve in a metric space
  length  If we have a topological metric space with distance function and a curve then the   length  of is where the supremum is taken over all partitions of the interval  Due to the triangle inequality  the insertion of another point into the partition does not decrease the sum  so that in particular the length of a curve from to is at least  If the length is finite  we call the curve   rectifiable   It is obvious from the definition that the length of a curve is independent of its parametrization and satisfies the additivity property with respect to chaining curves  Following the definition of the length of a curve  we can then define the   intrinsic metric generated by    as we defined the intrinsic metric for a Finsler space  Clearly the intrinsic metric is at least as great as the metric we started with 
Minimizers
 A curve whose length equals the intrinsic distance between its endpoints is called a   minimizer   minimizer  or a   shortest path   In Riemannian manifolds they are often called   geodesics    geodesic  but we will avoid that term for a while because there is another definition for geodesics  One of our major tasks will be to establish the relation between minimizers and geodesics  They will turn out to be not quite the same  geodesics turn out to be only   locally  minimizing  and furthermore  there are technical reasons why we should require that geodesics have a special parametrization  a constant-speed parametrization 
Existence of Minimizers
 We can establish the existence of minimizers for a Finsler metric within a connected compact set by using convergence techniques developed by nineteenth century mathematicians to show the existence of solutions of ordinary differential equations by the Euler method   Euler method  The main tool is the Arzel  a-Ascoli Theorem   Arzel  a-Ascoli Theorem  Cesare Arzel  a  1847-1912   Arzel  a  C   was a professor at Bologna  who established the case where the domain is a closed interval  and Giulio Ascoli  1843-1896   Ascoli  G   was a professor at Milan  who formulated the definition of uniform equicontinuity   uniform equicontinuity  A collection of maps from a metric space to a metric space is   uniformly equicontinuous  if for every there is such that for every and every such that we have  The word   uniform   refers to the quantification over all just as in   uniform continuity    while   equicontinuous   refers to the quantification over all members of the family  The definition is only significant for infinite families of functions  since a finite family of uniformly continuous functions is always also equicontinuous  Moreover  the application is usually to the case where is compact  so that uniform continuity  but not uniform equicontinuity  is automatic  If and are subsets of Euclidean spaces and the members of the family have a uniform bound on their gradient vector lengths  then the family is uniformly equicontinuous  Even if those gradients exist only piecewise  this still works  which explains why the theorem below can be used to get existence of solutions by the Euler method   Arzel  a-Ascoli Theorem  Let be compact metric space and assume that has a countable dense subset  Let be a collection of continuous functions  Then the following properties are equivalent   a  is uniformly equicontinuous   b  Every sequence in has a subsequence which is uniformly convergent on  There is a proof for the case where and are subsets of Euclidean spaces given in R  G  Bartle   Bartle  R G     The Elements of Real Analysis    2nd Edition  Wiley  page 189  No essential changes are needed for this abstraction to metric spaces   Local Existence of minimizers in Finsler Spaces   minimizer existence If is a Finsler manifold  each has nested neighborhoods such that every pair of points in can be joined by a minimizer which is contained in  To start the proof one takes to be a compact coordinate ball about and a smaller coordinate ball so that  using the curve-length estimates from the Nondegeneracy Lemma  any curve which starts and ends in cannot go outside unless it has greater length than the longest coordinate straight line in  Now for two points and in we define a family of curves parametrized on the unit interval  so that of the theorem will be with the usual distance on the line   We require that the length of each curve to be no more than the Finsler length of the coordinate straight line from to  We parametrize each curve so that it has constant   speed    which together with the uniform bound on length  gives the uniform equicontinuity of  We take to be the outer compact ball  By the definition of intrinsic distance there exists a sequence of curves from to for which the lengths converge to the infimum of lengths  If the coordinate straight line is already minimizing  then we have our desired minimizer  Otherwise the lengths will be eventually less than that of the straight line  and from there on the sequence will be in  By the AA Theorem  AA -- Arzel  a-Ascoli  there must be a uniformly convergent subsequence  It is fairly easy to prove that the limit is a minimizer  The minimizers do not have to be unique  even locally  For an example consider the or norm on to define the Finsler metric  the   taxicab metric      taxicab metric  Generally the local uniqueness of minimizers can only be obtained by assuming that the unit tangent balls of the Finsler metric are strictly convex  We won t do that part of the theory in such great generality  but we will obtain the local uniqueness in Riemannian manifolds by using differentiability and the calculus of variations  The result on existence of minimizers locally can be abstracted a little more  Instead of using coordinate balls we can just assume that the space is locally compact  Thus  in a locally compact space with intrinsic metric there are always minimizers locally  The proof is essentially the same 
Products
 If we have two metric spaces and then the Cartesian product has a metric whose square is   product mteric We use the same idea to get a Finsler metric or a Riemannian metric on the product when we are given those structures on the factors  When we pass to the intrinsic distance function of a Finsler product there is no surprise  the result is the product distance function  Prove that the projection into each factor of a minimizer is a minimizer   minimizer product space Conversely  if we handle the parametrizations correctly  then the product of two minimizers is again a minimizer 
Connections
  connection  We define an additional structure to a manifold structure  called a connection  It can be given either in terms of covariant derivative operators or in terms of a horizontal tangent subbundle on the bundle of bases  Both ways are important  so we will give both and establish the way of going back and forth  Eventually our goal is to show that on a semi-Riemannian manifold  including the Riemannian case  there is a canonical connection called the Levi-Civita connection   Levi-Civita  T 
Covariant Derivatives
  covariant derivative  For a connection in terms of covariant derivatives we give axioms for the operation associating a vector field to a pair of vector fields  1  If and are then is  2  is -linear in for real-valued functions on  That is  and  3  is a derivation with respect to multiplication by elements of  That is  and  We say that is the   covariant derivative of Y with respect to X   It should be thought of as an extension of the defining operation of vector fields so as to operate on vector fields as well as functions
Pointwise in Property
 Axiom 2 conveys the information that for a vector we can define  We extend to a vector field and prove  using 2  that is the same for all such extensions
Localization
 If and coincide on an open set  then and coincide on that open set 
Basis Calculations
 If is a local basis of vector fields  we define -forms locally by These are called the   connection -forms with respect  connection  -forms  to the local basis B   If we let be the dual basis to of -forms  and arrange them in a column and let then we can specify the connection locally in terms of by
Parallel Translation
 If we say that is  parallel translation   infinitesimally parallel  in the direction  If is a curve and for all we say that is   parallel along  and that is the   parallel translate  of along   Existence  Uniqueness  and Linearity of Parallel Translation  For a given curve and a vector there is a unique parallel translate of along to  This operation of parallel translation along is a linear transformation  If lies in a local basis neighborhood of then the coefficients of along when is parallel  satisfy a system of linear homogeneous differential equations  Globally we chain together the local parallel translations to span all of in finitely many steps  using the fact that is compact 
Existence of Connections
  connection existence  It is trivial to check that for a local basis we can set and obtain a connection in the local basis neighborhood  Then if covers is a connection on and is a subordinate partition of unity  partition of unity  we do not even have to require that only that the sum be locally finite   then the definition defines a connection globally on
An Affine Space
  affine space If and are connections  then for any we have that is again a connection  As runs through constants this gives a straight line in the collection of all connections on  Moreover  is -linear in and so defines a  1 2  tensor field such that  Conversely  for any  1 2  tensor field is a connection  We interpret this to say  s lThe set of all connections on is an affine space for which the associated vector space can be identified with the space of all  1 2  tensor fields on
The Induced Connection on a Curve
  connection on curve  If is a curve in a manifold which has a connection then we can define what we call the induced connection on the pullback of the tangent bundle to the curve  This is a means of differentiating vector fields along the curve with respect to the velocity of the curve  Thus  for each parameter value and will be another field  like along  There are various ways of formulating the definition  and there is even a general theory of pulling back connections along maps  see Bishop Goldberg  pp 220--224    Goldberg  S I    connection on map  but there is a simple method for curves as follows  Take a tangent space basis at some point of and parallel translate this basis along to get a parallel basis field for vector fields along  Then we can express uniquely in terms of this basis field  where the coefficient functions are smooth functions of  We define  From the viewpoint of the theory of pulling back connections it would be more appropriate to write instead of  In fact  the Leibnitz rule for this connection on is and we also have the strange result that even if it is possible to have  Even a field on a constant curve  which is just a curve in the tangent space of the constant value of the curve  can have nonzero covariant derivative along the curve 
Parallelizations
  parallelization  A manifold is called   parallelizable  if the tangent bundle is trivial as a vector bundle   For a given trivialization the vector fields which correspond to the standard unit vectors in are called the corresponding   parallelization  of  Conversely  a global basis of vector fields gives a trivialization of  If we set we get the   connection of the parallelization    connection of parallelation  For this connection parallel translation depends only on the ends of the curve  The parallel fields are constants  An even-dimensional sphere is   not  parallelizable  Lie groups are parallelized by a basis of the left-invariant vector fields  We shall see that for any manifold its bundle of bases and various frame bundles are parallelizable   bundle of bases
Torsion
  torsion If is a connection  then defines an -linear  skew-symmetric function of pairs of vector fields  called the   torsion  of  Hence is a tensor field  For a local basis with dual and connection form the torsion has -components The -valued -form is called the   local torsion -form  and its defining equation  torsion  -form  is called the   first structural equation   A connection with is said to be   symmetric    connection symmetric  For any connection the connection is always symmetric 
Curvature
  curvature For vector fields we define the   curvature operator  mapping a third vector field to a fourth one by  curvature operator   Some authors define this to be   As a function of three vector fields is -linear and so defines a tensor field  However  the interpretation as a -form whose values are linear operators on the tangent space is the meaningful viewpoint  For a local basis we have   local curvature -forms   with values which are matrices  which is the   second structural equation    second structural equation   curvature 2-form  The sign has been switched  so that the matrix of with respect to the basis is  The wedge product is a combination of matrix multiplication and wedge product of the matrix entries  just as it was in the first structural equation  so that  Calculate the torsion tensor for the connection of a parallelization  relating it to the brackets of the basis fields   connection torsion of parallelization  Calculate the law of change of a connection   connection law of change  that is  if we have a local basis and its connection form and another local basis and its connection form find the expression for on the overlapping part of the local basis neighborhoods in terms of and  In the case of coordinate local bases the matrix of functions is a Jacobian matrix  Check that the axioms for a connection are satisfied for the connection specified by the partition of unity and local connections  in the proof of existence of connections   partition of unity  Verify that the definition of leads to the local expression for given by the first structural equation  that is  and are assumed to be related by
The Bundle of Bases
 We let  bundle of bases   bundle of bases  This is called the   bundle of bases of M   and we make it into a manifold of dimension as follows  Locally it will be a product manifold of a neighborhood of a local basis with the general linear group consisting of all nonsingular matrices   general linear group  Since the condition of nonsingularity is given by requiring the continuous function   determinant  to be nonzero  can be viewed as an open set in so that it gets a manifold structure from the single coordinate map  Then if and we make the element of the product correspond to the basis  It is routine to prove that if has a structure  then the structure defined on by using local bases is a manifold structure on  The   projection map  given by is given locally by the product projection  so is a smooth map  The   fiber over p  is a submanifold diffeomorphic to  Each local basis can be thought of as a smooth map called a   cross-section of BM over U   The composition with is the identity map on   cross-section
The Right Action of the General Linear Group
  right action  Each matrix can be used as a change of basis matrix on every basis of every tangent space  This simultaneous change of all bases in the same way is a map given by  For we will also write  It is called the   right action of g on BM   For two elements we clearly have that is 
The Universal Dual -Forms
  cobasis universal   universal cobasis There is a column of -forms on existing purely due to the nature of itself  an embodiment of the idea of a dual basis of the basis of a vector space  These -forms are called the   universal dual -forms   are denoted and are defined by the equation  where is a tangent vector to at the point  We can also use multiplication of the row of basis vectors by the columns of values of the -forms to write the definition as  Thus  the projection of a tangent vector to is referred to the basis at which lives  and the coefficients are the values of these canonical -forms on   The canonical -forms are usually called the   solder forms  of   It is a simple consequence of the definition of that if is a local basis on then the pullback is the local dual basis of -forms  This justifies the name for  We clearly have that so that where is a tangent at  Rubbing out the       and       on both sides of the equation leaves us with an equation for the action of on  
The Vertical Subbundle
  subbundle vertical  The tangent vectors to the fibers of that is  the tangent vectors in the kernel of form a subbundle of TBM of rank  This is called the   vertical  subbundle of and is denoted by
Connections
  connection  A   connection on BM  is a specification of a complementary subbundle  subbundle horizontal  to which is smooth and invariant under all right action maps  The idea is that moving in the direction of on represents a motion of a basis along a curve in which will be defined to be parallel translation of that basis along the curve   parallel translation  We can then parallel translate any tangent vector along the curve in by requiring that its coefficients with respect to the parallel basis field be constant  The invariance of under the right action is needed to make parallel translation of vectors be independent of the choice of initial basis 
Horizontal Lifts
  horizontal lift  Since is complementary to the kernel of at each point of the restriction of to is a vector space isomorphism to  Hence we can apply the inverse to vectors and vector fields on to obtain   horizontal lifts  of those vectors and vector fields  We usually lift single vectors to single horizontal vectors  but for a smooth vector field on we take all the horizontal lifts of all the values of thus obtaining a   smooth  vector field  These vector field lifts are compatible with and all so that if is another vector field on then is right invariant and can be projected to  However  we have not assumed that is involutive  so that is not generally the horizontal lift of  The construction of the pull-back bundle and its horizontal subbundle is the bundle of bases version of the induced connection on the curve  More generally  the induced connection on a map has a bundle of bases version defined in just the same way   connection pullback to curve   connection induced  We can also get horizontal lifts of smooth curves in  This is equivalent to getting the parallel translates of bases along the curve  If the curve is the integral curve of a vector field then a horizontal lift of the curve is just an integral curve of  However  curves can have points where the velocity is making it impossible to realize the curve even locally as the integral curve of a smooth vector field  Thus  we need to generalize the bundle construction a little to obtain horizontal lifts of arbitrary smooth curves  We define the   pull-back bundle  to be the collection of all bases of all tangent spaces at points and give it a manifold with boundary structure  diffeomorphic to the product just as we did for along with a smooth map into  The horizontal subbundle can also be pulled back to a horizontal subbundle of rank  Then we have a vector field on whose horizontal lift has integral curves representing the desired horizontal lift of  This structure on corresponds to the connection on given above  When we relate all of this to the other version of connections in terms of covariant derivative operators  we see that the differential equations problem for getting parallel translations has turned into the familiar problem of getting integral curves of a vector field on a different space 
The Fundamental Vector Fields
  fundamental vector fields  Corresponding to the left-invariant vector fields on we have some canonically defined vertical vector fields on   each fiber is a copy of and these canonical fields are carried over as copies of the left invariant fields  Generally on a Lie group the left-invariant vector fields are identified with the tangent space at the identity  in one direction we simply evaluate the vector field at the identity  in the other direction  if we are given a vector at the identity as the velocity of a curve  then we can get the value at any other point of the group as the velocity of the curve at time  Note that whereas multiplies the curve on the left  which is what makes the vector field   left invariant   what we see nearby is the result of multiplying on the   right  by  It is this process of multiplying on the right by a curve through the identity that we can imitate in the case of since we have the right action of on  It is natural to view the tangent space of at the identity matrix as being the set of all matrices  which we denote by  If we let be the matrix with in the position and  s elsewhere  we get a standard basis of the Lie algebra  For a curve with velocity we can take simply  The   fundamental vector fields  on are the vector fields defined by We sometimes also call the constant linear combinations of these basis fields   fundamental

  connection  -forms  If we are given a connection on we define a matrix of -forms to be the forms which are dual to the vector fields on the vertical subbundle of and are on the connection subbundle  This means that if where is an matrix  then  Clearly the connection forms completely determine as the subbundle they annihilate  Thus  in order to give a connection it is adequate to specify the connection form  In order to say what matrices of 1-forms on determine a connection  besides the property that the restriction to the vertical gives forms dual to the fundamental fields we have to spell out the condition that is right invariant in terms of  The name for this condition is   equivariance   and things have been arranged so that it is expressed easily in terms of the differential action of and matrix operations 
The Basic Vector Fields
  basic vector fields  The universal dual cobasis is nonzero on any nonvertical vector  so that if we restrict it to the horizontal subspace of a connection it gives an isomorphism   If we invert this map and vary we get the   basic vector fields  of the connection  In particular  using the standard basis of we get the basic vector fields   they are the horizontal vector fields such that
The Parallelizability of BM
  parallelizability bundle of basis Since a connection always exists  we now know that is parallelizable  specifically  is a parallelization   Existence of Connections  again   There exists a connection on   connection existence  Locally we have that is defined to be a product manifold  We can define a connection locally by taking the horizontal subspace to be the summand of the tangent bundle given by the product structure  complementary to the tangent spaces of  In turn this will give us some local connection forms which satisfy the equivariance condition   equivariant form Then we combine these local connection forms by using a partition of unity for the covering of by the projection of their domains   This is no different than the previous proof of existence of a connection  
Relation Between the Two Definitions of Connection
 If we are given a connection on and a local basis then we can pull back the connection form on by to get a matrix of -forms on  This pullback will then be the connection form of a connection on in the sense of covariant derivatives  It requires some routine checking to see that these local connection forms all fit together  as varies  to make a global connection on in the sense of covariant derivatives   connection   covariant derivative  Conversely  if we are given a connection on in the sense of covariant derivatives  then we can define on the image of a local basis by identifying it with the local connection form under the diffeomorphism  Then the extension to the rest of above the domain of is forced on us by the equivariance and the fact that is already specified on the vertical spaces  The geometric meaning of the relation between the local connection form and the form on is clear  on the image of the form measures the failure of to be horizontal  by the differential equation for parallel translation the local form measures the failure to be parallel  But   parallel on    and   horizontal on    are synonymous  A form on is   horizontal   form horizontal  if it gives whenever any vertical vector is taken as one of its arguments  This means that it can be expressed in terms of the with real-valued functions as coefficients  A form on with values in is   equivariant   form equvariant  if  A form on with values in is   equivariant  if  The significance of these definitions is that the horizontal equivariant forms on correspond to tensorial forms on   corresponds to a tangent-vector valued form on corresponds to a form on whose values are linear transformations of the tangent space  The rules for making these correspondences are rather obvious  evaluate or on lifts to a basis of the vectors on and use the result as coefficients with respect to that basis for the result we desire on  The horizontal condition makes this independent of the choice of lifts  the equivariance makes it independent of the choice of  For example  the form corresponds to the -form on with tangent-vector values which assigns a vector to itself   The Structural Equations  If is a connection form on then there is a horizontal equivariant -valued 2-form and a horizontal equivariant -valued 2-form such that  first structural equation  and  second structural equation   curvature 2-form  The structural equations have already been proved in the form of pullbacks of the terms of the equations by a local basis  This shows how the forms and are given on the image of a local basis  The fact that these local forms yield the tensors and  torsion   curvature  which live independently of the local basis can be interpreted as establishing the equivariance properties of and since they are horizontal  It is also not difficult to prove the structural equations directly from the specified equivariance of  If we restrict the structural equations to vertical vectors  or one vertical and one horizontal vector  we get information that has nothing to do with connections  The first one tells how operates on  The second one is more interesting  it is the equations of Maurer-Cartan for which are essentially its Lie algebra structure in its dual packaging   Maurer-Cartan equations
The Dual Formulation
 The dual to taking exterior derivatives of -forms is essentially the operation of bracketing vector fields  If we bracket two fundamental fields or a fundamental and a basic field  we obtain nothing new  only a repeat of the Lie algebra structure and its action on Euclidean space  The brackets that actually convey information about the connection are the brackets of basic vector fields  By using the exterior derivative formula we see that the first structural equation tells what the horizontal part of a basic bracket is and the second tells us what the vertical part is  Most of the terms are   Similarly  We can immediately get some important geometrical information about a connection  The condition for the subbundle to be integrable is that the brackets of its vector fields again be within the subbundle  The basic fields are a local basis for so the condition for to be integrable is just that curvature be  This means that locally there are horizontal submanifolds  which are local bases with a very special property  whenever we parallel translate around a small loop the result is the identity transformation  or  parallel translation is locally independent of path  The fact that setting curvature to gives this local independence of path is not very obvious from the covariant derivative viewpoint of connections  If we go one step further and impose both curvature and torsion equal then the result is also easy to interpret from basic manifold theory applied to the fields on  Indeed  when a set of independent vector fields has all brackets vanishing  there are coordinates so that these fields are coordinate vector fields  When these are the of a connection on the coordinates correspond to coordinates on the leaves of which get transferred down to coordinates on such that the coordinate vector fields are parallel along every curve  The geometry is exactly the same as the usual geometry of Euclidean space  at least locally 
Geodesics
  geodesic of connection  A   geodesic  of a connection is a curve for which the velocity field is parallel  Hence  a geodesic is also called an   autoparallel curve    autoparallel curve  Notice that the parametrization of the curve is significant  since a reparametrization of a curve can stretch or shrink the velocity by different factors at different points  which clearly destroys parallelism   There is a trivial noncase  the constant curves are formally geodesics  But then a reparametrization does nothing   If we are given a point and a vector at we can take a basis so that  Then the integral curve of starting at is a horizontal curve  so represents a parallel field of bases along its projection to  Moreover  the velocity field of is the projection of at the points of the integral curve  but the projection of always gives the first entry of  We conclude that has parallel velocity field  The steps of this argument can be reversed  so that the geodesics of are exactly the projections of integral curves of  Any other basic field could be used instead of  Geodesics do not have to go on forever  since the field may not be complete  If is complete  so that all geodesics are extendible to all of as geodesics  then we say that is   geodesically complete    complete geodesically   Local Existence and Uniqueness of Geodesics   geodesic existence  For every and there is a geodesic such that  Two such geodesics coincide in a neighborhood about  There is a maximal such geodesic  defined on an open interval  so that every other is a restriction of this maximal one  This theorem is an immediate consequence of the same sort of statements about vector fields 
The Interpretation of Torsion and Curvature in Terms of Geodesics
 Recall the geometric interpretation of brackets  if we move successively along the integral curves of by equal parameter amounts we get an endpoint curve which returns to the origin up to order but gives the bracket in its second order term  We apply this to the vector fields on  The meaning of the construction of the   small parallelogram   on is that we follow some geodesics below on carrying along a second vector by parallel translation to tell us what geodesic we should continue on when we have reached the prescribed parameter distance  If we were to do this in Euclidean space  the parallelogram would always close up  but here the amount it fails to close up is of order and is measured by the horizontal part of the tangent to the endpoint curve in above  But we have seen that the horizontal part of that bracket is given by relative to the chosen basis  When we eliminate the dependence on the basis we conclude the following   The Gap of a Geodesic Parallelogram  A geodesic parallelogram generated by vectors with parameter side-lengths has an endgap equal to up to terms of order   geodesic parallelogram  The other part of the gap of the bracket parallelogram on is the vertical part  What that represents geometrically is that failure of parallel translation around the geodesic parallelogram below to bring us back to the identity  That failure is what curvature measures  up to terms cubic in  We can t quite make sense of this as it stands  because the parallel translation in question is not quite around a loop  however  if we close off the gap left due to torsion in any non-roundabout way  then the discrepancies among the various ways of closing up  as parallel translation is affected  are of higher order in  That is the interpretation we place on the following theorem   The Holonomy of a Geodesic Parallelogram  Parallel translation around a geodesic parallelogram generated by vectors with parameter side-lengths has second order approximation   holonomy  It seems to me that a conventional choice of sign of the curvature operators to make the       in the above theorem turn into a       is in poor taste  The only other guides for which sign should be chosen seem to be merely historic  The word   holonomy   is used in connection theory to describe the failure of parallel translation to be trivial around loops  By chaining one loop after another we get the product of their holonomy transformations  so that it makes sense to talk about a holonomy group as a measure of how much the connection structure fails to be like Euclidean geometry   holonomy group  Decomposition of a Connection into Geodesics and Torsion  Prove that if two connections have the same geodesics and torsion they are the same  Furthermore  the geodesics and torsion can be specified independently  In regard to the meaning of the last statement  we intend that the torsion can be any tangent-vector valued -form  the specification of what families of curves on a manifold can be the geodesics of some connection has been spelled out in an article by W  Ambrose  R S  Palais  and I M  Singer    Sprays   Anais da Academia Brasileira de Ciencias  vol  32  1960  But for the problem you are required only to show that the geodesics of a connection to be specified can be taken to be the same as some given connection   sprays   Ambrose  W    Palais  R S    Singer  I M   Holonomy of a Loop  Prove the following more general and precise version of the Theorem on Holonomy of Geodesic Parallelograms  s lLet be a smooth homotopy of the constant loop to a loop with fixed ends  so that  Fix a basis and let be the matrix which gives parallel translation of around the loop  Let and let be the lift of given by lifting each loop horizontally with initial point  In particular   Prove that  The meaning of the integrand on the right is as follows  We interpret a basis to be the linear isomorphism given by  Thus  for each we have a linear map As a matrix this can be integrated entry-by-entry  Hint  Pullback the second structural equation via and apply Stokes  theorem on the rectangle  The General Curvature Zero Case  Suppose that is connected and that we have a connection on for which that is  is completely integrable  Let be a leaf of that is  a maximal connected integrable submanifold  Show that the restriction of to is a covering map  Moreover  if we choose a base point then we can get a homomorphism of the fundamental group as follows  for a loop based at we lift the loop into necessarily horizontally  getting a curve in from to  Then depends only on the homotopy class of the loop   holomony  A connection with curvature zero is called   flat  and the homomorphism of Problem prob12 is called the   holonomy map  of that flat connection

Reverse Developments and Completeness
 Starting with a curve in such that we choose a basis and let  By Problem prob14 we can then get a curve in whose development is at least locally  We call the   reverse development  of  Since the vector field need not be complete  it is not generally true that every curve in can be reversely developed over its entire domain  We say that is   development-complete  at if every smooth curve in such that has a reverse development over its entire domain   completeness development-  Suppose that is connected  Show that the condition that be development-complete at is independent of the choice of  Show that the development of a geodesic is a ray with linear parametrization  and hence  if is development complete  then is geodesically complete   complete geodesically   connection of parallelization  For the connection of a parallelization show that the geodesics are integral curves of constant linear combinations   parallelization connection of   parallelization geodesics of connection  For the connection of a parallelization show that the reverse development of for which is an integral curve of  Show that if grows fast enough along a curve in then the development of with respect to the parallelization is bounded  Hence there is no reverse development having unbounded continuation  Show that the geodesics of the parallelization of Problem prob19 are straight lines except for parametrization  and on regions where even the parametrization is standard  Then by taking to be an unbounded curve with a neighborhood such that any straight line meets at most in a bounded set  and a function which is outside and grows rapidly along it is possible to get a connection  of the parallelization  which is geodesically complete but not development-complete   complete geodesically  Parallel translation along a curve is independent of parametrization  The only reparametrizations of a nonconstant geodesic which are again geodesics are the affine reparametrizations  A curve which can be reparametrized to become a geodesic is called a   pregeodesic    pregeodesic   geodesic pre-  Show that a regular curve is a pregeodesic if and only if for some real-valued function of the parameter 
The Exponential Map of a Connection

Normal Coordinates
  normal coordinates  Since is a vector space  the tangent space is canonically identified with itself  Using this identification  it is easily seen that the tangent map of at may be considered to be the identity map  In particular  by the inverse function theorem  there is a neighborhood of on which the inverse of is a diffeomorphism  Referring to a basis gives us an isomorphism to and the composition gives a   normal coordinate map  at   For normal coordinates it is clear that the coordinate rays starting at the origin of correspond to the geodesic rays starting at  Suppose that torsion is and that are normal coordinates at  For any show that and hence the operation of covariant differentiation of vector fields with respect to vectors at reduces to operating on the components of the vector fields by the vectors at

Metric Connections
 We now return to the study of semi-Riemannian metrics  and in particular  Riemannian metrics  If is such a metric  then we say that a connection is a   metric connection  if parallel translation along any curve preserves inner products with respect to  It is easy to see that there are several equivalent ways of expressing that same condition  Equivalent to a connection being metric are  em The parallel translation of a frame is always a frame  em The tensor field is parallel along every curve  em for all tangent vectors  em for all tangent vectors and all vector fields and  em Let be the   frame bundle  of consisting of all frames at all points of  It is easily shown that is a submanifold of of dimension  The condition equivalent to a connection being metric is that at points of the horizontal subspaces are contained in   bundle of frames
Orthogonal Groups
  orthogonal group   frame   frame bundle The frame bundle is invariant under the action of the orthogonal group with the corresponding index  This is the group of linear transformations which leaves invariant the standard bilinear form on of that index  Thus  if and only if for all  In case this reduces to the familiar condition for orthogonality   For other indices the matrix transpose should be replaced by the adjoint with respect to which we will denote by  The corresponding Lie algebra consists of the matrices which are skew-adjoint   Lie algebra orthogonal group  No matter what is  the dimension of is and since is locally a product of open sets  the domains of local frames   in times has dimension
Existence of Metric Connections
 In general  the definition and existence of a connection on a principal bundle  this means that the fiber is a Lie group acted on the right by a model fiber  can be carried out by imitating the case of   bundle of frames However  for we can obtain a connection by restricting a connection on and then retaining only the skew-adjoint part  Thus  if is a connection form on then for we let For the Riemannian case this means that we decompose the matrix into its symmetric and skew-symmetric parts and discard the symmetric part  Since the decomposition into these parts is invariant under the action of the orthogonal group by conjugation  similarity transform   it follows that the form on satisfies the equivariance condition  for all  On the vertical subspaces of the values of were already skew-adjoint  so that is an isomorphism of each vertical space onto  The number of independent entries of is  Consequently  the annihilated subspaces are a complement to the vertical ones  and by the equivariance condition  they are invariant under  That is  we have a connection on  What this means in terms of covariant derivatives on is that we can start with any connection   then for any frame field with respect to the metric we have defining the local connection forms  Then the local connection forms of a metric connection are obtained by taking the skew-adjoint part of
The Levi-Civita Connection
  The Fundamental Theorem of Riemannian Geometry  For a semi-Riemannian metric there exists a unique metric connection with torsion 0   Fundamental Theorem of Riemannian Geometry  In fact  the metric connections are parametrized bijectively by their torsions  To see this it is necessary to make the correspondence between the torsion form and the form where is an arbitrary metric connection form and will be the one with torsion  According to the first structural equation  which pulls back to unchanged in appearance  we would have or It is clear that determines so the problem reduces to showing that determines  The condition that the values of the connection forms  and hence  of are skew-adjoint with respect to the standard bilinear form must be used  The trick used to determine in terms of is to alternately apply the skew-adjointness  and first-structural equation relation  three times  By symmetry of the expression we began with and last term are the same  so This establishes the unique determination of by since is nondegenerate and the tangent vectors to can be chosen freely to give all possible values for  We can use this formula in both directions  we can start with and determine and hence   or we can start with and a given torsion and determine  There are several variants on the trick used to determine the Levi-Civita connection  Levi-Civita used it to determine the Christoffel symbols for a local coordinate basis  There is a basis-free version of it known as the   Koszul formula  for covariant derivatives   Christoffel symbols   Koszul formula  If we restrict attention to chosen from a local frame  then the first three terms of the Koszul formula vanish  for coordinate basis fields the last three vanish and we recapture Levi-Civita s formula   coframe  Frequently the most efficient way to calculate the Levi-Civita connection is to use a local coframe and the first structural equation with assumed to be zero and forced to be skew-adjoint  The fundamental theorem tells us that the information contained in the first structural equation is enough to determine  Often the equations can be manipulated so as to apply Cartan s Lemma on differential forms   Cartan s Lemma  and the are linearly independent -forms  then the -forms must be expressible in terms of the with a symmetric matrix of coefficients 
Isometries
  isometry  An   isometry  between metric spaces is a mapping which preserves the distance function and is - onto  In particular  it is a homeomorphism between the underlying topological spaces  If it is merely - then it is called an   isometric imbedding   We use the same words for the mappings which preserve a semi-Riemannian metric  An   isometry  from a semi-Riemannian manifold with metric tensor onto a semi-Riemannian manifold with metric tensor is a diffeomorphism such that for all tangents for all we have   imbedding isometric  An   isometric imbedding  is a map satisfying the same condition relating the tangent map and the metrics  but requiring only that it be a differentiable imbedding  this does not mean that the topology has to be the one induced by the map  only that the map be - and regular  Finally  for an   isometric immersion  we drop the requirement that it be -  Since covariant tensor fields  those of type  can be pulled back by tangent maps in the same way that differential forms are  we can also write the condition for isometric immersions as   We have seen that there are auxiliary structures uniquely determined by a semi-Riemannian metric or a Riemannian metric  Thus  the Levi-Civita connection is uniquely determined by the metric tensor and in the Riemannian case  lengths of curves and Riemannian distance are determined by the metric tensor  Moreover  the curvature tensor is uniquely determined by the Levi-Civita connection  These additional structures are naturally carried from one manifold to another by a diffeomorphism  Thus  it is obvious that these auxiliary structures are preserved by isometries  In particular  geodesics of the Levi-Civita connection are carried to geodesics by an isometry  this includes their distinguished parametrizations  Immediately we have that isometries commute with exponential maps   exponential map  On a connected semi-Riemannian manifold an isometry is determined by its value and its tangent map at one point  The group of isometries is imbedded in   bundle of frames  The group of isometries of a semi-Riemannian manifold into itself is a Lie group  The dimension of the group of isometries is at most where is the dimension of the original manifold 
Induced semi-Riemannian metrics
 If we have a differentiable immersion and has a semi-Riemannian metric then we get an induced symmetric tensor field of type on  In the Riemannian case is always positive definite  hence a Riemannian metric on   in the semi-Riemannian case it could even happen that is degenerate  or even if we assume that doesn t happen  on different connected components of could have different indices  When is indeed a semi-Riemannian metric  we say that it is the metric on   induced  by  Of course  then becomes an isometric immersion  or imbedding or isometry  depending on what other set-theoretic properties it has    Euclidean and semi-Euclidean spaces   semi-Euclidean spaces  When we consider with its standard coordinate vector fields we have first of all a parallelization  and hence the connection of that parallelization  It serves to give the usual identification of each tangent space of with itself  In turn  the standard inner product of index can be considered as defined on each tangent space  so that we have a semi-Riemannian structure of index called the semi-Euclidean space of index  We denote this by  When it is Euclidean space  When it is called   Minkowski  space  although there are other things  Finsler manifolds  called Minkowski space    Minkowski space  The dual -forms of the parallelization are the coordinate differentials  When we put them into a column and take exterior derivative we get  Setting clearly gives us the connection forms of the parallelization  but parallel translation also clearly preserves and torsion is obviously  By the fundamental theorem it follows that this same connection is also the Levi-Civita connection for all of these semi-Riemannian metrics  It is obvious that all of the translations are isometries of  They form a subgroup of dimension of the isometry group  Almost as obvious  compute the tangent map    for any orthogonal transformation the inner product viewed as a semi-Riemannian metric  is preserved by  This gives another subgroup of isometries  of dimension  Together the products of these two kinds of isometries form the full isometry group of   The   semi-Euclidean motion group     semi-Euclidean motion group  The motion group is transitive on and at each point  the tangent maps of isometries which fix that point are transitive on the frames at that point  Thus  the induced group on the bundle of frames is transitive  in fact  if we fix a base point of then the motion group becomes identified with with the base point as the identity of the group   Round spheres   spheres constant curvature  The points at distance from the origin in form the -dimensional sphere of radius  The induced Riemannian metric has as a group of isometries  and it easy to check that it is transitive on points and transitive on frames at  some conveniently chosen  point  Thus  we can identify with   the bundle projection can be taken to be the map which takes an orthogonal matrix to  first column   Since the isometry group is transitive on frames  and isometries preserve the curvature tensor of the Levi-Civita connection  the curvature tensor has the same components with respect to every frame  Along with symmetries shared by every Riemannian curvature  the invariance under change of frame is enough to determine the curvature tensor up to a scalar multiple  Certainly this is enough excuse to say that has   constant curvature    However  we shall amplify the meaning of constancy of curvature when we discuss sectional curvature  Assume the symmetries of the general Riemannian curvature tensor with respect to a frame  and  curvature symetries  s lFor a curvature tensor which has the same components with respect to every frame  discover what these components must be  up to a scalar multiple    curvature constant   Maurer-Cartan equations orthogonal group  In the case the unit sphere  the structural equations of the Levi-Civita connection on the bundle of frames are just the Maurer-Cartan equations of  One has to separate the left-invariant -forms on the group into those which correspond to the universal coframe and those which correspond to the connection forms  This gives a way of calculating the curvature components for problem 23  except for the multiple   coframe universal   Other quadric hypersurfaces  Analogously to what we did with round spheres  we consider quadric surfaces  For nonzero this always gives a submanifold for which the induced semi-Riemannian metric is nondegenerate and of constant index  That new index is if and if  In any case this gives us examples of metrics having a maximal group of isometries and   constant curvature   in the sense that the components of the curvature tensor are the same relative to any frame  Especially important is the case for then we get a Riemannian manifold   dual   to the round sphere  with constant curvature  which we will call negative curvature   There are two connected components  retaining only the upper component  we get the   quadric surface model of hyperbolic -space   There is an elementary argument to show that the geodesics of any of the quadric hypersurfaces are the intersections of the hypersurface with planes through the origin of  We use the fact that the isometries are so plentiful and they are induced by linear transformations of the surrounding space  which take planes into planes  Moreover  for any such plane  the isometries which leave it invariant are transitive on the intersection with the quadric surface  Thus  the parallel field generated by a tangent to that intersection must be carried into another parallel field tangent to that intersection  which can only be itself or its negative  In particular  the geodesics of a round sphere are the great circles  Describe examples of submanifolds of a semi-Riemannian manifold such that the metric induces tensor fields on the submanifolds which are degenerate  or are nondegenerate but not of constant index   Geodesics of quadric hypersurface  The idea of using the plethora of isometries to show that the geodesics of a quadric hypersurface are the intersections with planes through the origin is valid  but the argument given in the last paragraph does not work  Here is a correct argument  We show that there is an isometry leaving the intersection of the plane and hypersurface pointwise fixed  but taking every tangent vector perpendicular to the intersection into its negative  We must assume that the tangent vectors to the intersection are not null vectors  for which  The desired isometry is described in terms of a frame for the vector space with the bilinear form  The first frame vector is a normal to the hypersurface  as a quadratic form can be considered to be a real-valued function on and the gradient is taken relative to the inner product  at some point of the intersection  The second frame member is to be tangent to the intersection at that same point  Then the frame is filled out in any way  The isometry then takes this frame into the frame having the same first two members  so that it fixes the plane  and the remaining members of the frame replaced by their negatives  The existence of such an isometry forces the intersection curve to be a geodesic  The parallel field along that intersection generated by the tangent to the geodesic at the base point  i e   the second frame member  must be carried to a parallel field along the  fixed  intersection curve by the isometry  Since one vector  at the base point  of the parallel field is fixed  the whole field is fixed  But the only vectors fixed by the isometry are tangent to the intersection  Hence the  unit  tangent field along the intersection is parallel  making that curve a geodesic   quadric hypersurface  In case the induced metric on the quadric hypersurface has nonzero index  there will be null vectors  and the proof given will not apply to planes through the origin tangent to those null vectors  But the result is still true  since the limit of geodesics is still a geodesic  and the excluded planes can be obtained as limits of the others

  Killing field  A one-parameter  derivative Lie  subgroup in the isometry group of a semi-Riemannian manifold is  in particular  a one-parameter group of diffeomorphisms of the manifold  Hence  it is the flow of a complete vector field  More generally there will be vector fields whose local flows will be isometries of the open sets on which they are defined  These are called   infinitesimal isometries  or   Killing fields   We give an equation which describes Killing fields  derived by using the idea of a Lie derivative  When we differentiate tensors carried along by a flow with respect to the flow parameter  we get the Lie derivative of the tensor field with respect to the vector field generating the flow  When the flow consists of local isometries and the tensor field is the metric tensor itself  the tensors being differentiated are constant  so the derivative is Hence  we have  If is a Killing field  then  Consequently  a Killing field is characterized by the fact that the linear map on each tangent space given by is skew-adjoint with respect to  We derive the consequence of the   equation of a Killing field   namely  as follows  In terms of a local coordinate basis  applied with chosen from all pairs of coordinate vector fields  the equation of a Killing field becomes a system of linear first order partial differential equations for the coefficients of  Since the group of isometries has dimension at most we know   a priori  that there are at most that many linearly independent solutions for  In the case of Euclidean space we already know all the isometries  and hence can calculate the Killing fields from that knowledge too  but it is an interesting exercise to calculate them as solutions of a system of PDE  The Killing fields are named after Wilhelm Killing  1847-1923   who discovered the above equations  For calculate the Killing fields by solving the system of PDE s  There is a simple  but useful  relation between geodesics and Killing fields  generalizing a theorem of Clairaut on surfaces of revolution   conservation of energy   Conservation Lemma  Let be a geodesic and a Killing field  Then a constant along  If has unit speed  then is a lower bound on the length of along and hence  lies in the region where  If is perpendicular to at one point  then it is perpendicular to along its extent   Clairaut s Theorem  If is a geodesic on a surface of revolution  is the distance from the axis  and is the angle makes with the parallels  then is constant along  Hence  can never pass inside the   barrier     Clairaut s Theorem   barrier  Of course  the proposition can be interpreted as saying that the level hypersurfaces of form barriers to geodesics even in the general case  For the surface of revolution we take where is the angular cylindrical coordinate about the axis of revolution in space  is a Killing field of Euclidean space and its restriction to any surface of revolution is tangent to that surface  Clairaut s theorem is a very powerful tool for analyzing the qualitative behavior of geodesics on a surface of revolution  We develop this theme in the following problems  in which we suppose that the profile curve is expressed parametrically in terms of its arclength by giving and as functions of     geodesic surface of revolution  If is a critical point of then the parallel corresponding to this value of is a geodesic  If is not a critical point of then on any geodesic tangent to the corresponding parallel has a nondegenerate local minimum at the point of tangency  The meridians are geodesics  On the other geodesics  is strictly monotonic  and is strictly monotonic on arcs which contain no barrier point   meridian  On the usual donut torus is not monotonic between barriers for most geodesics  Classify the geodesics according to whether is periodic or not along the geodesic  and  if not  according to how it behaves relative to its barrier parallels  Suppose that we have a geodesic which traverses the gap between its barriers  neither of which are geodesics  Show that the angular change in between successive collisions with barriers is a continuous function of the geodesic for nearby geodesics  obtained  say  by varying the angle at a point through which we assume they all pass   Hence  either is constant or there are nearby geodesics which fill up the barrier strip densely and others which are periodic  closed  with arbitrarily long periods  The case of constant can actually occur  How 
Calculus of variations
  calculus of variations   energy   Euler equations  An important technique for discovering the extremal properties of functionals  usually looking for minimums of length  energy  area  etc   is the calculus of variations  A putative extremum is presumed to be within a family  whereupon the derivative of the functional with respect to the parameter s  of the family must be zero  Using the arbitrariness of the choice of family  we then obtain the   Euler equations  for extremals of the functional  These are usually differential equations which the mapping representing the extremal must satisfy  It is also called the   first variation condition     first   refers to   first derivate with respect to the parameter    Once the condition for the first variation to be zero is satisfied  the analogue of the second derivative test for a minimum is often employed  hence we must calculate the   second variation    similar to the Hessian of a function at a critical point   Hessian  Thus  the second variation is a quadratic form on the  infinite-dimensional  tangent space to the space of all mappings in question  The condition for a nondegenerate minimum is then that the second variation be positive definite  More subtle results are obtained by determining the   index  of the second variation  that is  the maximal dimension of a subspace on which the second variation is negative definite  If the Euler equations are elliptic  then the index will usually be finite  We won t get into this subtler analysis very much  it is known as   Morse theory    named after Marston Morse  who developed it for the length functional on the space of paths with remarkable success   Morse theory   Morse  M    rectangles - smooth   longitudinal curve   transverse curve
Variations of Curves--Smooth Rectangles
  For a given curve a   variation  of is a one-parameter family of curves such that is the curve obtained by taking the parameter value 0  Formally this is a mapping smooth as a function of two variables  such that  We call a   smooth rectangle  with base curve  The curves we get by fixing the second variable and varying are called the   longitudinal  curves of   the curves obtained by fixing the first variable are called the   transverse  curves of  The velocity fields of the longitudinal curves are united in the   longitudinal vector field   which is formally a vector field on the map  see Bishop and Goldberg   S5 7    Goldberg  S I   and can be denoted either or  Similarly  we have the   transverse vector field  or  The   variation vector field  is the vector field on obtained by restricting to the points  The first variation of length or energy depends only on the variation vector field  and when the base curve is critical with respect to these functionals  and we restrict to variations which satisfy reasonable end conditions  then the second variation also depends only on the variation vector field   This is analogous to the situation where a smooth function has a critical point  whereupon the second derivative becomes tensorial  
Existence of Smooth Rectangles  given the Variation Field
  If we are given a vector field on a curve then we can obtain a rectangle having as its variation field by using the exponential map of some connection   rectangles - smooth existence
Length and Energy
 If we have a Riemannian metric  we have already defined the length of a curve as the integral of its speed  The   energy  of is By Schwartz inequality applied to the functions and on the interval we obtain The condition for equality is that be proportional to in the sense of integration  i e   at all but a set of measure zero  Thus  we are allowed to apply this condition on piecewise smooth curves  so the conclusion is that we have equality for piecewise smooth curves if and only if the speed is constant  Hence  if we reparametrize curves so that they have constant speed  which doesn t change their lengths  then the energy functional becomes practically the same as the length functional for the purposes of calculus of variations  There is a technical advantage gained from using energy instead of length because the formulas for derivatives are simplified--similar to what happens in calculus when you choose to differentiate the square root of a function implicitly  If M is a Riemannian manifold  then a curve has minimum energy if and only if the curve has minimum length and is parametrized by constant speed   The comparison is among smooth curves connecting the same two points  parametrized on the same interval    critical energy   critical length   Lorentz manifold   time-like   space-like   elapsed time  In semi-Riemannian manifolds the concept of length does not have a meaning  so that the significant functional for the calculus of variations of curves is energy  However  in a Lorentz manifold of index the curves for which which are called time-like curves  have a special significance  they represent paths of   events   which an object could experience as time passes  For these curves the usual expression for length is called the   elapsed time    measuring the amount that a clock would change as it moved with the object  In a Lorentzian vector space the direction of the Cauchy-Schwartz and triangle inequalities  restricted to time-like vectors  is reversed  Thus  in Lorentz geometry we find that the time-like geodesics are the curves which locally   maximize  energy among nearby time-like curves  If one person moves on a geodesic while a second person starts out at the same time and place  accelerates away  and then steers backs to join the first person  the first person will age more than the second  A discussion of the inequalities is given in O Neill  Semi-Riemannian Geometry  p 144   O Neill  B    triangle inequality reversed   first variation arclength   first variation energy   First Variation of Energy and Arclength  Let be a smooth rectangle in a semi-Riemannian manifold  with base curve and variation field  Denote the longitudinal curves by  Then the first variation of energy is given by If is positive  then the first variation of arclength also makes sense and is given by  coframe universal  Covariant derivatives of vector fields along curves are defined in terms of parallel frames along curves  This amounts to lifting the curves to the bundle of frames  pulling back the universal coframe and connection form then using the usual formula  For an alternative approach which does not use bundles  but instead develops the idea of connections on maps and their pullbacks  see Bishop and Goldberg  Chapter 5  In particular  the fact that the torsion 0 exchange rule has meaningful terms and is true follows from the invariance of exterior calculus under pullbacks   connection on map   energy-critical curve  We define a curve to be   energy-critical  or   length-critical  within spaces of curves by the requirement that for all variations of the curve in the space the first variation of energy or length is  By elementary calculus it then follows that energy-minimal and length-minimal curves in the space are also critical  The space of curves used can be the smooth curves connecting two fixed points and parametrized on a fixed interval  More generally  we can let the ends of the curves vary on submanifolds  The generality of the domain interval is convenient because it allows us to apply results to subintervals immediately  if a curve is critical or minimal for certain endpoint conditions on the interval then its restriction to is critical or minimal for fixed endpoint variations over  Thus  after analyzing the fixed endpoint case we can easily discover what additional condition is needed for the variable endpoint case  If is energy-critical  length-critical  for smooth curves from to then is a geodesic  pregeodesic    geodesic   pregeodesic  There is a subtle mistake which should be avoided at this point in the development  we cannot immediately assert from the theorem that minimizing curves are geodesics  There are two gaps in the argument  minimizers may not exist  or if they do they may not be smooth  For the case at hand  dealing with the length of curves  we have taken care of the existence problem using the Arzel  a-Ascoli Theorem   Arzel  a-Ascoli Theorem  However  the example of the taxicab metric shows that we are still required to establish smoothness  Moreover  the failure to take care of these gaps in other contexts has generated some famous mistakes  recall the 1 9 th  century dispute over the Dirichlet principle  and in our era  the Yamabe   theorem   turned into the Yamabe   problem  precisely because the convergence to a critical map failed  yielding a nonsmooth object which was a generalized function  not a smooth map   Arzel  a-Ascoli Theorem   taxicab metric   Dirichlet principle   Yamabe problem   Gauss s Lemma  For the length functional on curves we handle the difficulty by imbedding the geodesic in a field of geodesics and applying Gauss s Lemma  For the special case of Euclidean space Problem prob4 and its hint shows how this works by using as the field of geodesics a field of parallel lines   Gauss s Lemma  Let be a variation of a geodesic such that all the longitudinal curves are geodesics with the same speed and having variation field  Then is constant  In particular  if is orthogonal to at one point  it is orthogonal everywhere  We have already seen a special case of Gauss s Lemma  namely  the proposition on Killing fields which we specialized to get Clairaut s Theorem  Given a Killing field and a geodesic segment we generate a variation by applying the flow of to   this satisfies the hypotheses of Gauss s Lemma  The fact that the variations of geodesics generated by the flow of a Killing field always yields geodesics for the longitudinal curves shows that a Killing field  restricted to any geodesic  is always a Jacobi field  defined as follows   Jacobi fields  If is a geodesic  a   Jacobi field  along is a vector field on such that on each subinterval of is the variation field of a variation for which the longitudinal curves are geodesics   Jacobi field  The longitudinal curves in this definition do not all have to have the same speed  so that the Jacobi fields dealt with by Gauss s Lemma are a little special  It is rather trivial to analyze the Jacobi fields which come from variations which don t move the base curve out of its trace  instead simply sliding and stretching the geodesic along itself  We have already stated how a geodesic can be reparametrized to remain a geodesic  and that s all there is to it  Thus  a Jacobi field which is tangent to the geodesic it sits on has the form for some constants and  We also have a clear idea of how freely we can vary geodesics in general  we can move the initial point to any neighboring point and the initial velocity to any neighboring velocity  Thus  the geodesic variations correspond to a neighborhood of the initial velocity in the tangent bundle  and the Jacobi fields  in turn  correspond to the tangents to the tangent bundle at that point  The Jacobi fields along a given geodesic form a space of vector fields of dimension   Rather trivial  Show that a vector field on is a Killing field if and only if along every geodesic has constant inner product with the geodesic s velocity  In fact  we shall soon calculate that the Jacobi fields satisfy a homogeneous linear second-order differential equation  so that the space of them is actually a vector space of dimension  The tangential ones form a subspace of dimension and Gauss s Lemma says  in effect  that the ones orthogonal to the base at every point form a subspace of dimension complementary to the tangential ones  In a normal coordinate neighborhood of the images under of the hypersurfaces form a family of hypersurfaces orthogonal to the radial geodesics from  The tangent map takes vectors orthogonal to the rays from the origin of to vectors orthogonal to the corresponding geodesic from  Note that both Gauss s Lemma and the above Proposition hold in the semi-Riemannian case  In the Riemannian case the local minimizing property of geodesics now follows by using as a field of geodesics the radial geodesics of the same speed starting from the initial point and applying the property given about that field in the Proposition  The local maximizing property of time-like geodesics in a Lorentz manifold of index is done in just the same way  using the fact that removing the orthogonal component of the tangent to a nearby curve then   increases  rather than decreases the elapsed time  Let be a Riemannian manifold  and the radius of a normal coordinate ball at  Then for any the radial geodesic segment from to is the shortest smooth curve from to  The   radius   referred to in the theorem is the distance measured in terms of the Euclidean formula with the normal coordinates  The value of that radius function at is the length of the radial geodesic  Hence we have If the ball of radius is normal  then the distance function is smooth on and its square is smooth at as well   The Jacobi equation  Let be a Jacobi field along a geodesic  We denote covariant derivatives with respect to by a prime  Then  Jacobi equation  The proof proceeds in a straightforward fashion by applying the first and second structural equations to a smooth rectangle generating the Jacobi field  In Euclidean space or in the connection is flat   Thus  the Jacobi equation is  But covariant differentiation is just differentiation of components with respect to the standard Cartesian coordinates  Hence the Jacobi fields are linear fields  where s is a linear parameter on a straight line  In a sphere of radius the curvature tensor is given for a unit speed geodesic by Hence the Jacobi differential equation splits into uncoupled second order differential equations for the components of with respect to a parallel frame along   for the components orthogonal to and for the component tangent to   Jacobi equation of sphere  For hyperbolic geometry the curvature is opposite in sign from that on the sphere  if  On a surface the curvature operator is expressed in terms of one component  the Gaussian curvature  If is orthogonal to unit vector we have  Thus  the Jacobi equation for a Jacobi field orthogonal to a geodesic is which is regarded as a scalar differential equation for the one component of

Exterior Covariant Derivatives
  covariant derivative exterior  If a tensor field is skew-symmetric in some of its vector arguments  say the last of the arguments  then after forming we can skew-symmetrize on the last vector arguments  obtaining a tensor field which we denote  This is called the   exterior covariant derivative  of viewed as an tensor valued -form  The second exterior derivative satisfies an identity which requires an explanation  so although it is not it does not depend on derivatives of components of only the pointwise value of and the curvature of the space   a  Explain how the explicit expression for comes from a product rule for the   product     b  Find the corresponding explicit expression for taking as conventional  are the -form arguments of which appear in is the vector on which operates  and is the additional argument for  In the semi-Riemannian case  keeping track of the signs is a source of considerable irritation  In what follows we do not generally sum on a repeated index when it is attached only to and one other letter  sometimes we use the sum convention in other settings  sometimes we stick in sum signs  Usually it should be clear from context whether a sum is intended   The Bianchi Identity   Bianchi identity The exterior covariant derivative of the curvature -form is  The formulation can be expanded to give the usual expressions as follows  The covariant differential is already skew-symmetric in the -form arguments it inherited from so that in order to skew-symmetrize on those two and the additional one we only need to throw in the cyclic permutation of the three  Thus  we get the equation for all vector fields  In terms of components with respect to a basis  not necessarily a frame   we take the first two indices of to be the indices of its matrix as a linear operator  so that one is up the other down  then the next two are its indices as a -form  hence subscripts  Taking the covariant differential adds another subscript  which is customarily separated from the others by a semicolon       or a solidus        Thus  in index notation the Bianchi identity is written The usual application of the Bianchi identity is to prove Schur s theorem that a semi-Riemannian manifold with pointwise constant curvature and dimension at least has constant curvature  We state it precisely and then combine the proof with a proof of the Bianchi identity   curvature constant   Schur s Theorem  Let be a connected semi-Riemannian manifold of dimension such that there is a function such that the local expression for the curvature forms is  Then is constant  The local coframe expression given is what we call   pointwise constant   curvature   coframe  The hypothesis about local coframe expression passes over to a claim that the global expression for the curvature forms on looks the same  where now is the pullback to of the former  Thus  is a real-valued function which is constant on fibers  so that to show it is constant we only need to show that its derivatives in the horizontal directions are i e    In general we have Now the general procedure for calculating the exterior covariant derivative of a tensor-valued form is to pass to the corresponding equivariant form on take exterior derivative  and then take the horizontal part  We note that every term of has vertical factors  so the horizontal part is  This proves the Bianchi identity  Now we continue the calculation supposing that the curvature forms have the pointwise constant curvature expression  Now we see that in order for this expression to have no horizontal component the first term must vanish for all and  If we can choose and different from any given so that we must have for all as required 
Sectional Curvature
  sectional curvature   curvature sectional The curvature tensor is the major invariant of Riemannian geometry  it entirely determines the local geometry in a sense spelled out precisely by the Cartan Local Isometry Theorem   Cartan Local Isometry Theorem  However  it is too complicated to use directly in the formulation of local hypotheses which have significant geometric consequences  Thus  it is important to repackage the information it conveys in a more tractable form  the sectional curvature function  In two-dimensional spaces this reduces to a function on points  since there is only one -plane section at each point  namely  the tangent plane  the sectional curvature is then just the Gaussian curvature  which is a component of with respect to a frame  In higher dimensions the sectional curvature is still a real-valued function  but the domain consists of all -dimensional subspaces of all the tangent spaces  which we call   sections    Gaussian curvature  Let be a section and let be a frame for  Then the sectional curvature of is In the semi-Riemannian case this must be modified slightly  it is not defined if the section is degenerate  so there is no frame for it  but even in the case where the metric is indefinite on we change the sign  so that the result will conform to the more general formula for in terms of an arbitrary basis of  Then we can write and we get  using the symmetries of A straightforward calculation  starting with the inverse expressions for and in terms of and gives The sign is positive if is definite  positive or negative  on and negative if is indefinite  In the Riemannian case the geometric meaning of the expression  eq areal  is that it is the square of the area of the parallelogram with edges  If we take another frame for then the calculation shows that the result for is the same whether we use  eq dagger  or  eq ddagger   showing that we have really defined  Following the prescription given for the sign  the general formula given for sectional curvature in terms of an arbitrary basis is thus For sections in the direction of pairs of frame vectors  spanned by we introduce the signs and get expressions for sectional curvature in terms of curvature components   curvature constant  If the curvature at is constant in the sense of having the same components with respect to every frame  then as a map it must be a constant multiple of the identity map     A priori  this claim is true for possibly different multiples depending on the signature of the section  but one checks that it works in general by making some Gallilean boost change of frames   Hence the sectional curvature is that same constant for all sections   Gallilean boost   curvature space of tensors

Normal Coordinate Taylor Series

Conjugate Points
  conjugate point  Let and let be a geodesic through  A point on is a   conjugate point of p along  if there exists a Jacobi field on such that vanishes at both and  We could equivalently define a conjugate point of to be a singular value of for if we had such that then defines a Jacobi field along the geodesic such that and   To interpret we use the canonical isomorphism of with its tangent spaces   Both viewpoints of conjugate points are important  The definition as given shows that the relation   is a conjugate point of   is symmetric  and on the other hand  by applying Sard s Theorem to we obtain that the set of all conjugate points of forms a set of measure   Sard s Theorem   Sard  Arthur  Moreover  the singular value property gives us the following theorem  which is half of the property of local nonminimization beyond a first conjugate point of along  In a more general setting  such as a locally compact intrinsic metric space  we would take this geometrically significant  metric space intrinsic property as the   definition  of a conjugate point   Local Nonminimization Implies Conjugate Point  Let be a nonselfintersecting geodesic segment such that for every neighborhood of there is such that there is a shorter curve in from to than  Then has a conjugate point of  Suppose there are no conjugate points of on  Then is a diffeomorphism of some neighborhood of onto a neighborhood of  Moreover  we may assume that is so small that is also a diffeomorphism on the   cone    We can also take a central normal ball so small that intersects only in an initial radial segment of  Let  Then is a diffeomorphism onto a neighborhood of which is thereby filled with a field of radial geodesics uniquely connecting points to  Now we use the proof of the minimization theorem  page 25  to show that if then is the shortest curve in from to  To turn the local nonminimizing property into a characterization of first conjugate points it is necessary to free ourselves of the restriction that be nonselfintersecting  We do this by taking the neighborhoods in question to be a neighborhood in the space of rectifiable curves starting at  To topologize the space of curves we parametrize them with constant speed on and use the topology of uniform convergence  We construct as we did above  and take to be any central normal ball  so that for some is a diffeomorphism of some neighborhood of within onto the -ball centered at for every  Then any rectifiable curve which is uniformly -close to can be lifted uniquely to a curve in  This means that we can define a unique radial geodesic to each point of the curve  so that we can carry out the comparison of lengths as in the proof of Theorem thm firstvar   second variation
Second Variation
 We have seen that when we vary a geodesic to nearby curves with the same endpoints  then the first derivative of energy or arclength is  Moreover  if there is no conjugate point  then the critical value of energy or length actually is a local minimum  As in calculus  to gain information about what is happening at a critical point we need to look at second derivatives  We will only do the simple case for which the endpoints are fixed  the more general case in which we study the distance to a submanifold would require some notions that we have not defined    focal points  and  focal point  the   second fundamental form of a submanifold    second fundamental form The details of the more general case can be found in Bishop Crittenden or other references  We assume that the geodesic base curve and the longitudinal curves of the variations we consider are normalized in their parametrization  so  parametrization normalized  that they have constant speed and are parametrized on  Intuitively it is clear that we don t lose anything by such a restriction  It makes energy equal to the square of the length among the curves under consideration  so that there is no difference which we choose to calculate with  Moreover  the restriction is fitting to the conclusion we want to draw  by showing that some second derivative is negative we conclude that the value is not a minimum  Thus  it is some particular special variations that we want to discover from a calculation of second variation  and great generality is not required as long as what we do points to the special variations needed  So suppose that is a smooth rectangle with base geodesic and constant end transversal curves  and longitudinal parameter  Let be the longitudinal vector field and the transverse vector field  We will use such facts as and without going through some formal justification  Our starting point is the formula for first variation of energy  Differentiating with respect to again  Now we evaluate at so that because the base curve is a geodesic  and the term which can be integrated drops out because the end transverse curves are constant  at  For the term we have an alternative form and again the direct integration of the derivative drops out because of the fixed end condition  We also simplify the notation  writing and when  Thus  we get   Synge s formula for second variation    Synge s formula 2nd variation   Synge  J L   There are several interesting features to note  The result only depends on the variation vector field along the base  not on other properties of  This is an illustration of the rule that when a first derivative vanishes  then the second derivative becomes tensorial  The formula is a quadratic form in so that it makes sense to consider the corresponding bilinear form  which is called the   index form for variations of the base curve   The formulas for the index form are rather transparent  just replace one of the  s in each term by a to get   index form  From the second expression we see that if we can take to be a Jacobi field  so that the two ends of the base geodesic are conjugate points of each other  then the second variation vanishes  In fact  for every which tells us that the Jacobi field is in the nullspace of the index form   nullspace index form  Conversely  if for every then we must have that is is a Jacobi field  Hence we have identified the nullspace of   it consists of Jacobi fields which vanish at both ends   Nonminimization Beyond Conjugate Point  If a geodesic segment has an interior conjugate point  then it is not minimal   nonminimization beyond conjugate point  Make the parametrization be such that is a conjugate point of and extends beyond to some  Using the nontrivial Jacobi field which vanishes at and as a variation field  we obtain a variation of that first part of for which the change in arclength is  These varying curves form angles at with looking backwards proportional to up to higher order  If we cut across the obtuse angles formed  the saving in length is on the order of so that saving is greater in magnitude than the gain in length that we have from the variation  Hence there must be shorter curves nearby connecting and  The claim in the proof that   the saving in length is on the order of    requires a proof  for which we introduce some second variations of vector fields which are not at the ends  For a vector field along we still define an index form To interpret as a second derivative of the energy of some rectangle we note that in leading up to  eq    when we had a fixed-end variation  we integrated terms  Thus  the weaker condition at and would also suffice to derive  eq    For any given this condition can be attained by letting the initial and final transverse curves be geodesics  In fact  that was how we showed the existence of a variation attached to a given variation field anyway  Moreover  we also want to interpret  eq    as a second derivative in the case where is only continuous and piecewise  We can do so if we require that at the finite number of places where does not exist we have   in particular  it is again enough to make the transverse curves at those places be geodesics   The Basic Inequality  Suppose that there are no  basic inequality  conjugate points of on  Let be a piecewise vector field on orthogonal to such that  Let be the unique Jacobi field such that and  Then and equality occurs only if  The inequality is actually an immediate consequence of the minimization of energy by geodesics  if we take a rectangle such that and the final transversal is a geodesic  then we can define another rectangle by making be the geodesic from to  Then so also  To show that the case of equality requires we make a calculation involving a basis of of the Jacobi fields which are at and perpendicular to at  The we can write where the coefficients are piecewise  We let If and are Jacobi fields along a geodesic then is constant  If and vanish at the same point  then the constant is so that  Let  Differentiating the difference we have by the symmetry in pairs of  Now we have The integrand in is thus Note that and are continuous  piecewise so that we can integrate to get We make the same calculation with wherein the field corresponding to is and are the same  Thus  and the condition for equality is that the piecewise continuous field hence the are constant and  This completes the proof of the Basic Inequality  Now we can give a precise version of the proof that geodesics do not minimize beyond conjugate points  Let be a conjugate point of and let be a nonzero Jacobi field vanishing at and  If we extend by a segment of 0-vectors beyond we will still have  Let be a positive number such that there is no conjugate point of on  Reparametrize  and scale correspondingly  so that  We will indicate vector fields along by a triple designating what they are on each subinterval  For example  denotes the vector field which is on on and on  As long as we force the tranverse curves at the break points to be geodesics  the summing of index forms for subintervals will represent a sum of second derivatives of energies which gives the second derivative of the whole  Let be the Jacobi field such that and  Then we satisfy the condition for the basic inequality on the interval so that Since there is a vector field having negative second variation  the longitudinal curves of any rectangle fitting it are shorter than on the order of  This completes the proof of the nonminimization beyond conjugate points  In Problem prob30 the condition that the field be a Jacobi field along every geodesic should be derived from the fact that it is a Killing field independently of the other parts of the problem   Killing field  The following kind of metric comes up in classical mechanics because the space of positions of a rigid body rotating about a fixed point is and the kinetic energy of the rigid body can be viewed as a Riemannian metric having the left-invariance considered  A general theorem of mechanics of a freely moving conservative system  conservative system says that the free  unforced motions are geodesics of the kinetic energy metric  See Bishop Goldberg  chapter 6  On and we have parallelizations by left invariant vector fields satisfying The dual basis satisfies the Maurer-Cartan equations  Maurer-Cartan equations  We introduce a left-invariant metric for which the are orthogonal and have constant lengths   Hence where the are the Levi-Civita connection forms for our metric  By Cartan s Lemma  and  Cartan s Lemma are linear combinations of and hence have no term  By cyclic permutations we conclude that each connection form is a multiple of a single basis element  Then the first structural equations give us what are  using a little linear algebra  and the cyclic permutations  We continue by calculating the curvature by using the second structural equations  and again cyclicly  Thus  the curvature as a symmetric operator on bivectors is diagonal with respect to the assumed basis  We reduce the numerator to a sum and difference of squares to see whether the curvatures can be negative  where
Loops and Closed Geodesics
  This material is from Bishop Crittenden  Section 11 7  with little change    Crittenden  R J  A   closed geodesic   or   geodesic loop  is a geodesic segment for which the initial and final points coincide  A   smooth  closed geodesic  or   periodic  geodesic is a geodesic loop for which the initial and final tangents coincide   geodesic closed   geodesic loop  In a compact Riemannian manifold we can get convergent subsequences of a family of constant speed curves uniformly bounded in length  using the Arzel  a-Ascoli theorem   Arzel  a-Ascoli Theorem  If we have a continuous loop with base point we can obtain a rectifiable curve in the same homotopy class by replacing uniformly confined subsegments  which exist by uniform continuity  by unique minimal geodesic segments  Then we can reparametrize the resulting piecewise smooth curve by its constant-speed representative  all parametrized on  Applying the Arzel  a-Ascoli Theorem to a sequence of such homotopic constant-speed curves with length descending to the infimum length produces a loop of   minimum  length in the homotopy class  It is obviously a geodesic loop  More generally  the same procedure works in a   complete  Riemannian manifold   Completeness is next on the agenda   In a compact Riemannian manifold each pointed homotopy class of loops contains a minimal geodesic loop   homotopy class  If we allow the base point to float during homotopies  then we get   free  homotopy classes of loops  If we connect a loop back and forth to a base point by a curve  then the resulting pointed loops  as we vary the connecting curve  give conjugate elements of the fundamental group  In this way we associate uniquely to a free homotopy class of loops a conjugate class in the fundamental group   fundamental group   conjugate homotopy class  Using the same trick  in a compact manifold we can extract a periodic  geodesic periodic   homotopy class free  geodesic representative of a free homotopy class of loops  However  in the complete  but noncompact  case the trick does not necessarily work because the length-decreasing sequence can go off to infinity  For pointed loops that does not happen because closed bounded sets are compact  and everything takes place in a closed ball about the base point   Synge s Theorem on Simple Connectedness  If is compact  orientable  even-dimensional  and has positive sectional curvatures  then is simply connected   Synge s Theorem   simply connected   curvature positive  The idea is to use second variation to show that a nontrivial periodic geodesic cannot be minimal in its homotopy class  By parallel translation once around such a periodic geodesic  we get a map of the normal space to the geodesic at the initial point into itself  Because that map has determinant  Why   and the normal space is odd-dimensional  there must be an eigenvalue equal to hence a fixed vector  This fixed vector generates a parallel field joining up smoothly at the ends since is fixed by parallel translation  Thus  the second variation of an attached rectangle is so there are nearby homotopic shorter curves  We give some variations on the same theme as problems  Let be compact  even-dimensional  nonorientable  and have positive curvature  Show that the fundamental group of is   fundamental group  Let be compact  odd-dimensional  and have positive curvature  Show that is orientable   orientable   Klingenberg  W    Klingenberg s Theorem  A method of Klingenberg gives us either geodesic loops or conjugate points  The hypothesis can be weakened to completeness and an assumption that there is a cut point  The definition of cut points and the facts used about them will be given after we discuss completeness   Klingenberg s Theorem  Let be compact  and a point

Otherwise  there will be local distance functions and giving the distance from in neighborhoods of and respectively  In a neighborhood of the equation defines a smooth hypersurface not perpendicular

Completeness
  completeness   Cauchy sequence   metric space complete  In a topological metric space a sequence is a   Cauchy sequence  if for every there is such that for all we have  A convergent sequence is a Cauchy sequence  If every Cauchy sequence is convergent  then is a   complete  metric space  If some subsequence of a Cauchy sequence converges  then the sequence itself converges  Hence a compact metric space is complete   completion  A noncomplete metric space has an essentially unique   completion   a complete metric space in which is isometrically imbedded and no unnecessary identifications are made among the points added to make the space complete or among those and the original points of  There is a standard way of constructing the completion  start with the set of all Cauchy sequences  put an equivalence relation on that set  requiring two sequences to be equivalent if the sequence which results from interleaving them is still Cauchy  the metric is extended to the set of equivalence classes by taking the limit of distances   we imbed isometrically in this set of equivalence classes as the classes represented by constant sequences  The completion of a Riemannian manifold does not have to be a manifold  For example  we can start with the Euclidean plane  make it noncomplete by puncturing it  then we can take the universal simply connected covering manifold  As a manifold is just diffeomorphic to the plane  However  as a metric space there is only one equivalence class of Cauchy sequences which does not converge  the projection of a representative converges to the point we removed  In terms of Riemann surface theory is the Riemann surface of the complex logarithm function  that is  the locally defined log can be defined as a single-valued complex-analytic function on  So we call the   logarithmic covering  of the punctured plane   logarithmic covering  Discover a topological property of the completion of the logarithmic covering which shows that it is not a manifold   metric space intrinsic  Recall that a metric space is   intrinsic  if the distance between two points is the infimum of lengths of curves between the points  We say that a metric space is a   geodesic  metric space if it intrinsic and for every pair of points there is a curve between the points whose length realizes the distance between the points  A space is   locally geodesic  is every point has a neighborhood in which distances between pairs from that neighborhood are realized by curve lengths  Thus  we have seen that a Riemannian manifold is a locally geodesic space   geodesic space   geodesic space locally  If we parametrize a geodesic in a Riemannian manifold by the arc length measured from some point on it  then it becomes an isometric immersion from an interval to the Riemannian manifold  We have realized the geodesics as the projections of the integral curves of the vector field on  In particular we will have   maximal  geodesics   geodesic maximal  ones which cannot be extend as geodesics to a larger interval  the domain is always an open interval  If that interval is not all of then there will be a Cauchy sequence in the interval converging to a finite end  The image distances are no farther apart  hence also a Cauchy sequence  Thus  if the Riemannian manifold is complete  the limit point of that sequence can be used to extend the geodesic to one more point  We have called this ability to always extend a geodesic to a finite end of its domain   geodesic completeness   We have therefore proved   completeness geodesic  A complete Riemannian manifold is geodesically complete  That is  maximal geodesics are defined on the whole real line  The converse of this theorem is known as the Hopf-Rinow Theorem  proved in its original form by H  Hopf and W  Rinow  On the concept of complete differential-geometric surfaces  Comment  Math  Helv  3  1931   209-225    Hopf  H    Rinow  W    Hopf-Rinow Theorem   de Rham  G   It was recognized later  by de Rham  that it was important to weaken the hypothesis a little more  if we assume that just those geodesics extending from a single point can be extended infinitely  then the Riemannian space is complete  It was that form which has become accepted as the classical form of the Hopf-Rinow Theorem  Strangely  an even better version was proved in 1935  S  Cohn-Vossen  Existenz Kurzester Wege  Doklady SSSR 8  1935   339-342   Cohn-Vossen  S   The Cohn-Vossen version is applicable to locally geodesic spaces which have maximal shortest paths of finite length  the de Rham improvement  requiring the extendibility of only those geodesics which originate from some single point  is also valid for Cohn-Vossen s version  The Hopf-Rinow-CohnVossen Theorem   Hopf-Rinow-CohnVossen Theorem If is a locally geodesic space such that there is a point for which every maximal geodesic through is defined on a closed interval  then is a complete metric space  Of course  for locally compact spaces  the assumption that the space is locally geodesic can be derived from the metric being intrinsic  In the same context  of locally compact intrinsic complete metric spaces  it then follows that the space is globally geodesic  The modern form of the H-R-CV theorem specifies several equivalent conditions and a consequence  This facilitates the proof of the main implication  which was stated as the H-R-CV theorem above   The Hopf-Rinow-CohnVossen Theorem   Hopf-Rinow-CohnVossen Theorem In a locally compact intrinsic metric space the following are equivalent  em  i   Every halfopen minimizing geodesic from a fixed base point extends to a closed interval  em  ii   Bounded closed subsets are compact   This is often said  is finite--compact   em  iii   is complete  em  iv   Every halfopen geodesic extends to a closed interval  Any of these implies  is a geodesic space  i e   any two points may be joined by a shortest curve   We start with an outline of proof  We establish a cycle and then the final assertion is clear from  The implication is true in any metric space and we have already noted the truth of above  is trivial  Thus  the more difficult part  is left  So let us assume with base point and define The idea is to show that is both open and closed in   In the Riemannian case is the image under of the intersection of the domain of with the closed ball in of radius  The proof of the fact that is compact then follows by using the continuity of  From there the pattern of proof was given by deRham  copied into Bishop Crittenden    Crittenden  R J   Now we give the details of the proof of the H-R-CV theorem   1  is compact for all  The set of for which is compact is an interval  for if and is compact  let be a sequence in  A sequence of minimizing segments from to lies in the compact set so by the Arzel  a-Ascoli Theorem has a convergent subsequence   Arzel  a-Ascoli Theorem  The limit curve is necessarily a minimizing geodesic  and its endpoint is the limit of the corresponding subsequence of and is in  The interval is open  for if is compact  then by local compactness we can cover it by a finite number of open sets having compact closure  The union of these closures will contain all points within distance of so it will be a compact set containing  Repeating the above argument with replaced by and by shows that the latter is compact  Suppose that where is finite  Let be a sequence in and a minimizing geodesic from to  Using the compactness of for we construct successive subsequences for each which converge on where  Then the diagonal subsequence converges to a minimizing halfopen geodesic segment on  By hypothesis  this halfopen geodesic has an extension to which provides a limit point of and a minimizing geodesic to it from  Thus  is compact  contradicting the assumption that  Hence  that is  all are compact   2  The set of all for which is an interval  Indeed  if every point at distance or less can be reached by a minimizing geodesic from and if then certainly every point of distance or less can be so reached   3  is closed  If is a limit point of elements in then is certainly a limit of points  Since is compact    4  is open  If then we can cover by a larger compact set including some so the latter is compact  For a sequence of curves from to with lengths converging to will eventually be in  By the Arzel  a-Ascoli Theorem there will be a subsequence converging to a minimizing segment from to so that  Hence  showing that is open 
Cut points
  cut point  In this section we consider Riemannian manifolds  The notion of a cut point in a more general space  such as a complete locally compact interior metric space  or even a complete Riemannian manifold with boundary  is difficult to formulate so as to retain the nice properties that cut points have in complete Riemannian manifolds  Also  they don t make much sense in noncomplete Riemannian manifolds  If is a geodesic  then is a   cut point   or   minimum point  of p along   if realizes the distance but for every does not realize the distance  If is a cut point of then either there are two minimizing segments from to or is a first conjugate point of along a minimizing segment   Let and suppose that is a sequence converging to and that is a curve from to such that the length of is less than the length of the segment of from to  Since we have assumed that the space is complete  we may as well suppose that is a minimizing segment  We take a convergent subsequence  the limit of which will be a minimizing segment from to  If the limit is then is not one-to-one in a neighborhood of   this shows that is a conjugate point of along  The relation   is a cut point of   is symmetric  This follows from the fact that both relations   has two or more minimizing geodesic to   and   is a first conjugate point of   are symmetric  The symmetry of the latter follows from the characterization of conjugate points by Jacobi fields  It is not hard to show that the distance to a cut point from along the geodesic with direction is a continuous function of to the extended positive reals  The manifold is compact if and only if there is a cut point in every direction  If we remove the cut locus of from the manifold  then the remaining subset is diffeomorphic to a star-shaped open set in the tangent space via  In particular  the noncut locus is homeomorphic to an open -ball  This shows that all the nontrivial topology of the manifold is conveyed by the cut locus and how it is glued onto that ball  The cut locus is the union of some conjugate points  which have measure by Sard s Theorem   Sard s Theorem  and subsets of hypersurfaces obtained by equating   local distance functions from     the localization being in neighborhoods of minimizing geodesics to the cut points  Thus  the cut locus has measure  Other than that it can be very messy  H  Gluck and M  Singer have constructed examples for which the cut locus of some point is nontriangulable   Gluck  H    Singer  M    cut locus nontriangulable

Hadamard manifolds
 A complete Riemannian manifold with nonpositive curvature is called an   Hadamard manifold    Hadamard manifold  The two-dimensional case was studied by Hadamard  and then his results were extended to all dimensions by Cartan  There is a further generalization to manifolds for which some point has no conjugate points  We first show that nonpositive curvature implies that there are no conjugate points   conjugate point  If is a Riemannian manifold with nonpositive curvature  then there are no conjugate points  We have to show that if is a nonzero Jacobi field such that then is never again  Note that since and are deterministic initial conditions for the second-order Jacobi differential equation  Now differentiate twice  which is at time and which is positive at time  But we may assume that is perpendicular to the base geodesic  and that the velocity field of that geodesic is a unit vector field  Then  Hence  so that only vanishes at time   The Hadamard-Cartan Theorem   Hadamard-Cartan Theorem If is a complete Riemannian manifold having a point such that has no conjugate points  then is a covering map  If curvature is nonpositive  then that is true for every and every fixed-end homotopy class of curves contains a unique geodesic segment  If is simply connected  then it is diffeomorphic to via  We are given that is a local diffeomorphism everywhere  From covering space theory it is sufficient to show that it has the path-lifting property  given a curve and a point such that we must show that there is a curve such that and  We can pullback the metric on to get a metric on  The radial lines from the origin are geodesics in this metric  so that by the H-R-CV Theorem the new metric on is complete  We can use the local regularity of to lift an open arc of a curve about any point where we have it lifted already  Thus  it becomes a matter of extending from a halfopen interval to the extra point  On a large closed ball in which is compact  there will be a positive lower bound on the amount distances will be stretched by   hence a Cauchy sequence approaching the open end in will be lifted to a Cauchy sequence in providing the point to continue the lift   Myers  Theorem   Myers  S    Myers  Theorem  Let be a complete Riemannian  curvature positive  manifold such that there is a positive number for which for all tangent vectors  Then is compact with diameter at most  We show that along every geodesic there must be a conjugate point within distance  Let be a geodesic parametrized by arc length  and let be a parallel frame field along with  We define fields along which would be Jacobi fields vanishing at 0 and if had constant sectional curvature   for  Then the index form has value We are given that so that if we add the index forms we get If there were no conjugate point on the interval in question  then the basic inequality tells us that the index form would be positive definite  Hence there is a conjugate point and there can be no point at distance from greater than  We have proved a slightly better result than claimed  We don t have to assume that   all  Ricci curvatures are positively bounded below  but only those for tangents along geodesics radiating from a single point  Then we still get compactness  but not the estimate on the diameter  The   radius   radius of Riemannian manifold of a Riemannian manifold is the greatest lower bound of radii of metric balls which cover  Prove that in general  Moreover  the upper bound can be obtained from completeness and the assumption that the Ricci curvatures of tangents along geodesics radiating from a single point have the lower bound assumed in Myers  Theorem   curvature Ricci  When the condition on Ricci curvature reduces to a lower bound on the Gaussian curvature  the conclusion of Myers  Theorem was known for this case much earlier and this result is called Bonnet s Theorem   Bonnet s Theorem

  There is an improved method of doing comparison theorems  refining the technique of using Jacobi fields as in Bishop Crittenden  employing Riccati equations as well   Riccati equation  A good reference for this approach is J -H  Eschenburg  Comparison Theorems and Hypersurfaces  Manuscripta Math  59 1987   295-323   Eschenburg  J -H   One of the starting points of modern comparison theory is the Rauch Comparison Theorem   Rauch Comparison Theorem   Rauch  H   It says that if we have an inequality on sectional curvatures at corresponding points of two geodesics  then the opposite inequality holds for corresponding exponentiated tangent vectors  In effect we compare growth of Jacobi fields when we are given a curvature comparison and the same initial conditions for the Jacobi fields   Jacobi equation  The reason that Riccati equations are sometimes more convenient is that they come close to conveying just the right amount of information  while the Jacobi equation has too much detail  If we are concerned with estimating the distance to a conjugate point  we are interested in whether there is a one-dimensional subspace of Jacobi fields with zeros at two points  the Jacobi equation determines individual members of that subspace  while the Riccati equation is aimed at the subspace itself  For the two-dimensional case the interest centers on the fields orthogonal to a geodesic  so that the equations are given in terms of one scalar coefficient  The Jacobi equation is where is the Gaussian curvature  Gaussian curvature along the geodesic  The Riccati equation is where is related to by  The distance between conjugate points is the distance between two singularities of  Those singularities are all of the same sort  with approaching from the left  from the right  and asymptotically behaves like at a singularity  For the higher dimensional case we deal with the vector Jacobi equation  while the Riccati equation is a matrix Riccati equation whose solutions package all the solutions of the Jacobi equation  Geometrically the matrix of the Riccati equation represents the second fundamental forms of a wave front  so the Riccati equation itself expresses how the relative geometry of those wave fronts evolve as one moves orthogonally to them  When we radiate from a point the wave fronts are metric spheres  but the equations have the same form for wave fronts radiating from any submanifold  To describe a   wave front    wave front  or family of parallel hypersurface all that is required is a real-valued function having gradient of unit length everywhere  such that  Then the hypersurfaces are the level hypersurfaces of  We let the metric dual of   that is  the vector field such that for all vector fields  Then we calculate for any tangent vector   We can take an extension of such that and is constant  hence so that Thus  the integral curves of are geodesics  The distances between the hypersurfaces are measured along these geodesics  A case of particular importance is the distance function defined on a deleted normal neighborhood of for which the wave fronts are the concentric spheres about   concentric spheres  Let the Hessian  Hessian tensor of  Then is in the nullspace of so that we will be mainly concerned with the restriction of to the normal space  As defined by is a linear map which is the shape operator  Weingarten map   Weingarten map   second fundamental form  of the hypersurfaces  But we also can view as the second fundamental form  the symmetric bilinear form  Usually it will be the operator version that occurs here  Suppose that is a vector field orthogonal to such that  Then  Applying again we get Define the symmetric linear operator by  Since the vector field can have arbitrary pointwise values perpendicular to we get the following operator Riccati equation for    Riccati equation matrix  Still assuming that we get which is the Jacobi equation  so such a must be a Jacobi field along the integral curves of  We can take such fields which are orthogonal to at some point  and use them to make a linear isomorphism which we denote by  The row of derivative fields can also be regarded as such a linear map  so that makes sense as a linear operator on  Writing the definition of as the fact that satisfies the same Riccati equation is just a repeat of the previous calculation  Finally  we can rig and at one point so that coincides with at that point  hence everywhere  This establishes the usual relation between the Riccati equation and the corresponding second-order linear equation  here the Jacobi equation 
Reduction to a Scalar Equation
 If we assume that has a simple eigenvalue then locally will be a smooth function and will have a smooth unit eigenvector field  We show that satisfies a scalar Riccati equation  Riccati equation scalar  of the same form  where the driving operator is replaced by a sectional curvature function  We have used the symmetry of and the fact that since the derivative of a unit vector is always perpendicular to the unit vector itself  We cannot generally assume that the eigenvalues of will be simple  However  we can always perturb an initial value of so that the perturbed solutions of the Riccati equation will have simple eigenvalues locally  Then an upper or lower bound on the eigenvalues derived from the scalar equation can be applied to the eigenvalues of the matrix equation by taking a limit as the perturbations go to  This will serve our purposes even in case has multiple eigenvalues 
Comparisons for Scalar Riccati Equations
 We consider the Riccati equations of the form where are real-valued functions of a real variable  In our geometric applications will be the sectional curvature of a section tangent to a geodesic  and has interpretations as a principal normal curvature  eigenvalue of the second fundamental forms  of a wave front  or a connection coefficient for a frame field adapted to the setting  A basic trick in dealing with the scalar Riccati equation is the change to the corresponding linear homogeneous second order equation  We let and then easily calculate  Conversely  a solution of the second order equation leads to a solution of the Riccati equation  Of course  is only determined up to a ratio  The trick may be viewed as splitting the second order equation into two first order steps  the Riccati equation and the linear equation  We assume that is continuous  A solution on either extends continuously to a solution in a neighborhood of 0  or  In either case is uniquely determined on by its value whether finite or  Similarly  on is uniquely extendible to   We must have a Taylor expansion for the corresponding linear equation solution  If gives us the continuous extension  If then as and  The second order equation determines a solution such that up to a constant multiple  so that is uniquely determined when is a singularity  If we determine a unique solution for by then the unique solution singular at is given by   Take the limit of the corresponding solution for which satisfies initial conditions   Driving Function Comparison Theorem  If  which may be    and then exists on at least as great an interval as does and on that interval   Note that continues until as    Let  Then  If is finite  we multiply both sides of this inequality by to get  Since and we conclude that on  But can only become singular by going to so that g must exist on too  If then we set use the result just proved  and take a limit as   The Sturm Comparison Theorem  If and these solutions are not trivial  then the next of occurs at or before the next of   Sturm Comparison Theorem   Value Comparison Theorem  If and then on the maximal interval on which exists  Again let so that  Clearly on   Rauch Comparison Theorem   Rauch Comparison Theorem Let M and N be Riemannian manifolds  and unit speed geodesics in each  and their unit tangent vector fields  Suppose that for every pair of vector fields and orthogonal to and respectively  we have an inequality on sectional curvatures at corresponding points   Let and be nonzero Jacobi fields orthogonal to and respectively  such that and have the same length  Then is nondecreasing for   in particular  is at least as long as  We start by calculating the logarithmic derivative of the length of a Jacobi field   For Jacobi fields vanishing at an initial point the operators are the shape operators of the spherical wave front  wave front spherical  about that point  On both manifolds these operators have a simple pole as their initial conditions  By the driving function comparison theorem the eigenvalues of the operators for the spheres on and are related oppositely to the relation for curvature  That inequality on eigenvalues is then passed on to an inequality for the logarithmic derivatives  and we have supposed that and are asymptotically the same at  Note that we did not have to assume that the dimensions are the same  The most common application is a comparison to constant curvature spaces  which can be stated conveniently as follows   bounded curvature   curvature bounded   Constant Curvature Comparison Theorem  Suppose that the sectional curvatures of are bounded by constants   Let and be the simply connected complete Riemannian manifolds of constant curvatures and of the same dimension as  Let and be exponential maps for and respectively  each restricted to a normal neighborhood  Then is length nonincreasing and is length nondecreasing   For convenience we have identified the three tangent spaces by some Euclidean isometry   To keep the directions of the inequalities correct you should always bear in mind particular comparisons  say of the Euclidean plane with the unit sphere  it is easy to visualize that the Euclidean lines spread apart faster than great circles making the same initial angle  An equivalent way of viewing the constant curvature comparison is in terms of triangles   triangle comparison  The triangles compared should be sufficiently small so that they lie in a normal coordinate neighborhood and in the sphere are uniquely determined by the three side lengths  For a given triangle in the   comparison triangle  is the triangle in the constant curvature surface having the same side lengths  Then an inequality on curvatures  say  is conveyed by inequalities between the angles and corresponding distances across the two triangles  the angles are smaller and the distance shorter in the comparison triangle than in the given triangle  Alternatively  instead of making the three sides the same  one can make two sides and the included angle the same in the given triangle and the comparison triangle  with obvious consequent inequalities between the other corresponding   parts   of the triangles  This called   hinge comparison   hinge comparison  Alexandrov  Alexandrov  A D    Alexandrov space  has turned these triangle comparisons into definitions  for  singular space  geodesic metric spaces  of what it means for the space to have curvature bounded above or below by a constant  This allows an extension of many ideas of Riemannian geometry to   singular   spaces  For example  he proves that if curvature is bounded above  then the angle between two geodesic rays with a common starting point is well-defined and satisfies many of the usual properties  However  an angle and its supplementary angle has sum but equality may fail  The metric completion of the logarithm spiral surface  logarithmic spiral surface covering the punctured Euclidean plane has curvature but geodesic rays starting at the singular point can have arbitrarily large angle between them  Generally  in spaces with curvature bounded above geodesics may bifurcate  which is an indication of some infinitely negative curvature   but locally a geodesic segment is uniquely determined by its ends   curvature positive  The opposite case of spaces with curvature bounded below has also been studied  Here again angles are meaningful  for the two-dimensional case  the sum of angles about a point can be at most and if it is less  the point is regarded as having positive curvature measure  Geodesics cannot bifurcate  but local bipoint uniqueness may fail and indicate positive infinite curvature  Examples of this sort are obtain by gluing two copies of a convex Euclidean set along their boundaries  the   double  of the set   When a locally compact metric space has curvature bounded both above and below then it is very close to being a manifold  To make it be a manifold we only have to assume one further very natural property  geodesics must be locally extendible  With this hypothesis  Nikolaev  Nikolaev  I G   proved that there is a manifold structure and the metric is given by a Riemannian metric  The number is a H  older exponent for the last derivatives  and can be any number between and  Curvature bounds defined in Alexandrov s way are easily seen to be inherited by the limits of spaces  for some reasonable notions of such limits  Thus  Nikolaev s theorem has an important consequence that some limits of Riemannian manifolds are actually Riemannian manifolds  There is a general compactness theorem of Gromov which shows that many such limits exist   Gromov  M    Gromov Compactness Theorem  Another kind of result which Alexandrov was able to abstract to spaces with curvature bounded above was the proof that one could compare certain global triangles  given that local ones could be compared  For example  he proved a generalization of the Hadamard-Cartan Theorem to  Hadamard-Cartan Theorem  locally compact complete geodesic metric spaces with curvature bounded above by  Recently S  Alexander and I generalized this even more  using instead the weaker assumption of geodesic convexity and eliminating the hypothesis of local compactness   Alexander  S 
Volume Comparisons
 For a Riemannian manifold we can get comparisons between the volume of balls and spheres  and more generally  tubes  and corresponding volumes in constant curvature spaces founded on curvature inequalities  For   lower  bounds on volume it is hard to do much better than to assume upper bounds on   sectional  curvature and apply the length nondecreasing maps that we get from the Rauch comparison theorem  The more interesting case is to get   upper  bounds on volumes from the weaker assumption of lower bounds on   Ricci  curvature   Ricci curvature   curvature Ricci   Bishop s Volume Comparison Theorem   Bishop s Volume Comparison Theorem If for all unit vectors then for each ball and sphere the Riemannian volume  n-dimensional and  n-1 -dimensional  respectively  is less than or equal to that for a ball or sphere of the same radius in a space of constant curvature  For the result holds for all   for the result holds for all  In either case it is permissible to let be noninjective while its counterpart in the constant curvature space is injective  since counting parts of volume more than once enhances the inequality  This refinement is now attributed to Gromov  but I knew it and thought it was so trivial as to be unnecessary to say explicitly  However  it turned out to be important in applications  The method of proof is to estimate the Jacobian determinant of the exponential map  by calculating the logarithmic derivative  That much is similar to the proof of the Rauch theorem  We express that Jacobian determinant in terms of the length of an -vector  This was done directly in the original proof  given in Bishop Crittenden  Chapter 11   Crittenden  R J   Now the fashion is to use an operator Riccati equation as intermediary  converting it to a scalar Riccati equation for by taking the trace   Riccati equation
