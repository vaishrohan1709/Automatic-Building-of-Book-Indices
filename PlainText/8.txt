Introduction
 Free analysis  free analysis  KVV14 and the theory of free functions and free sets traces its roots back to the work of Taylor Taylor1  Taylor2  Free functions generalize the notion of polynomials in -tuples of freely noncommuting variables and free sets are appropriately structured subsets of the union  over of -tuples of matrices  The current interest in the subject arises in large part due to its applications in free probability Voi04 Voi10 systems engineering and connections to optimization Ball11 BGR BGFB94 dOHMP09 Skelton and operator algebras and systems Arv69 Arv72 Pau BLM Pisier-book  Davidson  Davidson-Kennedy  The main branch of convex optimization to emerge in the last 20 years  semidefinite programming  semidefinite programming  Nem06 is based on linear pencils   linear pencil  linear matrix inequalities  linear matrix inequality   LMI   LMIs  and spectrahedra  spectrahedron  BGFB94 WSV  The book BPR13 gives an overview of the substantial theory of LMIs and spectrahedra and the connection to real algebraic geometry  A linear pencil is a simple special case of a free function and is of special interest because the free spectrahedron     is evidently convex and conversely an algebraically defined free convex set is a free spectrahedron EW HM12  In this article the relation between inclusions of spectrahedra and inclusions of the corresponding free spectrahedra is explored using operator theoretic ideas  The analysis leads to new dilation theoretic results and to new probabilistic results and conjectures which can be read independently of the rest of this article by skipping now to Section sec introprob  It also furnishes a complete solution to the matrix cube problem of Ben-Tal and Nemirovski BtN which contains  as a special case  the -Theorem of Nesterov Nes97 and which in turn is related to the symmetric Grothendieck Inequality  A central topic of this paper is dilation   dilation  up to a scale factor  of a tuple of symmetric matrices in a free spectrahedron to tuples of commuting self-adjoint operators with joint spectrum in the corresponding spectrahedron  We shall prove that these scaled commutative dilations exist and the scale factor describes the error in the free relaxation of the spectrahedral inclusion problem      The precise results are stated in Section sec op-dil  As a cultural note these scale factors can be interpreted as the amount of modification required to make a positive map completely positive  see Section sec cpINTRO  In this paper we completely analyze the free cubes  free cube       the free spectrahedra consisting of -tuples of symmetric matrices of norm at most one  the corresponding spectrahedron is the cube  We show that  for each there exists a collection of commuting self-adjoint contraction operators on a Hilbert space  such that  up to the scale factor     any symmetric contraction matrix dilates to in   see Section sec dilate and cube  Moreover  we give a formula for the optimal scale factor   see Section sec precise  As a consequence  we recover the error bound given by Ben-Tal and Nemirovski for the computationally tractable free relaxation of the NP-hard cube inclusion problem  Further  we show that this bound is best possible  see Section sec mcINTRO  Proof of sharpness of the error bound and giving a formula for requires concatenating all of the areas we have discussed and it requires all but a few sections of this paper  For example  finding a formula for required new results for the binomial and beta distributions and necessitated a generalization of Simmons  Theorem Sim1894  cf  PR07  to Beta distributions  Our results and conjectures in probability-statistics appear in Section sec introprob  The rest of the introduction gives detailed statements of the results just described and a guide to their proofs 
Simultaneous dilations
 Denote by the set of positive integers and by the set of real numbers  For denote by the set of symmetric matrices with entries from  A matrix   dilates  to an operator on a Hilbert space if there is an isometry such that  Alternately  one says that is a  fcompression  of  A tuple   dilates  to a tuple of bounded operators on a Hilbert space if there is an isometry such that  in the sense that  In other words  has the form    T i  X i 	   i
   i 	   i    where the are bounded operators between appropriate Hilbert spaces  One of the oldest dilation  dilation  theorems is due to Naimark N43  In its simplest form it dilates a tuple of  symmetric  positive semidefinite matrices  of the same size  which sum to the identity to a tuple of commuting  symmetric  projections which sum to the identity   dilation Naimark  It has modern applications in the theory of frames from signal processing  In this direction  perhaps the most general version of the Naimark Dilation Theorem dilates a  possibly nonselfadjoint  operator valued measure to a  commuting  projection valued measure on a Banach space  The most general and complete reference for this result and its antecedents is HLLL14 with HLLL14b being an exposition of the theory  See also LS13  A highly celebrated dilation result in operator theory is the power dilation theorem of Sz -Nagy  theorem Sz -Nagy  SzN53 which  given a contraction constructs a unitary such that dilates to for natural numbers  That von Neumann s inequality  von Neumann s inequality   theorem von Neumann  is an immediate consequence gives some measure of the power of this result  The two variable generalization of the Sz -Nagy dilation theorem  the power dilation of a commuting pair of contractions to a commuting pair of unitaries  is known as the commutant lifting theorem  there are counterexamples to commutant lifting for more than two contractions  and is due to Ando  Foias-Sz -Nagy  Sarason  It has major applications to linear systems engineering  see Ball11 FFGK BGR as samples of the large literature  The  latest revision of the  classic book contains further remarks on the history of dilations  Power dilations up to a scale factor are often called -spectral dilations and these are a highly active are of research  An excellent survey article is BB13  The connections between dilations and completely positive  completely positive map  maps were exposed most famously in the work of Arveson Arv69 Arv72  Presently  dilations and completely positive maps appear in many contexts  For examples  they are fundamental objects in the theory of operator algebras  systems and spaces Pau as well as in quantum computing and quantum information theory NC  In the articles HKM12 HKM13 the theory of completely positive maps was used to systematically study free relaxations of spectrahedral inclusion problems which arise in semidefinite programming Nem06 WSV and systems engineering BtN for instance  In this article  dilation theory is used to measure the degree to which a positive map can fail to be completely positive  equivalently the error inherent in free relaxations of spectrahedral inclusion  The dilation constant for dilating contractions to commuting contractions operators is given by the following optimization problem BtN which is potentially of independent interest   beq  fra c1   h d       min   substack a in R d

Dilations to commuting operators
 The general dilation  dilation  problem is as follows  given a linear pencil and a tuple does dilate to a commuting tuple of self-adjoint operators with joint spectrum in   Suppose is a monic linear pencil in -variables and the corresponding spectrahedron is bounded  Because there exist constants and such that    c    cubeg  subset  cD L  subset C    cubeg     from Theorem thm dilate it follows that for each and there exists a a Hilbert space a commuting tuple of self-adjoint operators on with joint spectrum in and an isometry such that    X   V    fra c1  t  T V     The largest such that for each the tuple dilates to a commuting tuple of self-adjoint operators with joint spectrum in is the   commutability index of    commutability index   denoted by   If is not bounded  then there need not be an upper bound on   The constants and Theorem thm BtN below produce bounds on depending only upon the monic pencil and
Spectrahedral inclusion problem
 Given two monic linear pencils and corresponding spectrahedra  determine if the inclusion holds  The article HKM13 considered the free variable relaxation of this inclusion problem  dubbed the  ffree spectrahedral inclusion problem   when does the containment hold  In HKM13 HKM12 it is shown  via an algorithm and using complete positivity  that any such free inclusion problem can be converted to an SDP  semidefinite programming   SDP  feasibility problem  whose complexity status is unknown but is believed to be efficient to solve in theory and practice  cf    See also Section sec cpINTRO below  
Accuracy of the free relaxation
 Now that we have seen free spectrahedral inclusion problems are in principle solvable  what do they say about the original inclusion problem  Inclusion of free sets implies trivially the inclusion of the corresponding classical spectrahedra Conversely  in the case that is bounded there exists such that c cubeg  subset  cD   L   subset C  cubeg  and hence there exists an such that     fs L  subset  fs  L  qquad implies  qquad r  cD L  subset    cD  L     We call such an an  f - -inclusion constant   Theorem thm BtN and the constants produce a lower bound on  Let denote the largest such  if is not assumed bounded  then a largest need not exist  and let    r L  d     min   r L  L   L  mbo x is of size   d  mbo x and    fs L subset  fs   L        We call the sequence the  f -inclusion scale   The connection between spectrahedral inclusions and general dilations arises as follows  Suppose is a monic linear pencil and is bounded  em The commutability index for equals its inclusion scale   That is is the largest constant such that    au L  d     cD L  subset  cD  L    for each and monic linear pencil of size satisfying em If is balanced i e   for each we have then for each The proof appears in Section sec generally free
Interpretation in terms of completely positive maps
 The intimate connection between dilations and completely positive maps was first exposited by Stinespring Sti55 to give abstract necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of dilations  The theme was explored further by Arveson  see e g  Arv69  Arv72   we refer the reader to Pau for a beautiful exposition  We next explain how our dilation theoretic results pertain to  completely  positive maps  The equality between the commutability index and the inclusion scale  Theorem thm scottDilated-intro  can be interpreted via positive and completely positive maps  Loosely speaking  each unital positive map can be scaled to a unital completely positive map in a uniform way  ef mB S mathbb S  Suppose is such that the associated spectrahedron is bounded  If is another -tuple  consider the unital linear map  beq  Phi   span  I A 1  A g  	 o   span  I  A 1  A g

Matrix cube problem
 Given the matrix cube problem  matrix cube problem  of Ben-Tal and Nemirovski BtN is to determine  whether  While their primary interest in this problem came from robust analysis  semidefinite programming with interval uncertainty and quadratic Lyapunov stability analysis and synthesis   this problem is in fact far-reaching  For instance  BtN shows that determining the maximum of a positive definite quadratic form over the unit cube is a special case of the matrix cube problem  cf  Nesterov s -Theorem Nes97  theorem Nesterov s   or the Goemans-Williamson GW95 SDP relaxation of the Max-Cut problem    theorem Goemans-Williamson  Furthermore  it implies the symmetric Grothendieck inequality   theorem Grothendieck  A very recent occurrence of the matrix cube problem is described in BGKP see their Equation  1 3   There a problem in statistics is shown equivalent to whether a LMI  whose coefficients are Hadamard products of a given matrix  contains a cube  Of course  one could test the inclusion by checking if all vertices of the cube are contained in  However  the number of vertices grows exponentially with the dimension  Indeed the matrix cube problem is NP-hard BtN Nem06   see also KTT13  A principal result in BtN is the identification of a computable  theorem Ben-Tal  Nemirovski  error bound for a natural relaxation of the matrix cube problem  In HKM13 we observed this relaxation is in fact equivalent to the free relaxation  free relaxation   matricial relaxation   With the notations introduced above  we can now present the theorem of Ben-Tal and Nemirovski bounding the error of the free relaxation   BtN   Given and if then    a   em   em if is an upper bound for the ranks of the then  Part  a  of Theorem thm BtN is shown  in Theorem thm nextbest to be a consequence of our Dilation Theorem thm dilate  A further argument  carried out in Section sec rankvsize establishes part  b   In this article we show that the bound in Theorem thm BtN  a   and hence in  b   is sharp  Suppose and If then there is and such that but  See Section sec optkstar  Theorem thm scottDilated-intro applied to the free cube s  implies  for a given that equals and  for fixed the sequences and termwise decrease with to a common limit  which  in view of Theorems thm BtN and thm sharp turns out to be  In particular  for any and any -tuple of symmetric contractive matrices there exists a -tuple of commuting self-adjoint contractions on Hilbert space such that dilates to a statement considerably weaker than the conclusion of Theorem thm dilate
Matrix balls

 The rest of this article is organized as follows  Results relating dilations to free spectrahedral inclusions needed for the proofs of the results for the matrix cube are collected in Section sec liftslite  Further general results on free spectrahedral inclusions and dilations appear in Section sec generally free  The results of Section sec expectaverage simplify the identification of the optimum as defined by Equation  eqre feq BTbd   They also identify  implicitly  constrained versions of this optimum  The results of the previous sections are combined in Section sec thetaBest to prove Theorem thm dilate and Theorem thm sharp as well as the weaker version of Theorem thm BtN which asks that the matrices have size and not just rank at most  In Section sec prequest the constrained optima from Section sec expectaverage are identified  still implicitly  in terms of the regularized incomplete beta function  a result needed to complete the proof of Theorem thm BtN in Section sec rankvsize as well as in the remaining sections of the paper  Theorem thm thetaExplicit is reformulated in terms of the beta function in advance of the following three sections which together establish Theorem thm thetaExplicit  A half-integer generalization of Simmons  Theorem  inspired by the strategy in PR07 using two step monotonicity  is the topic of Section sec simmhalf  A new lower bound for the median of the Beta distribution and bounds for the equipoint appear in Section sec lowBdSIS and the bounds for the equipoint are used in Section sec nov to complete the proof of Theorem thm thetaExplicit  Estimates for in the case that is odd appear in Section sec odd  Section sec balls considers the problem of including the unit ball in into a spectrahedron  and uses dilation theory to prove the worst case error inherent in its free relaxation  namely  Finally  further probabilistic results and their proofs are exposited in Section sec shortprob  The reader interested only in probabilistic results can proceed to Sections sec simmhalf sec lowBdSIS and sec shortprob  The reader interested only in the matrix cube problem can skip Section sec generally free   whereas the reader interested only in dilation results  absent formulas for  can focus on the sections up through and including Section sec generally free  The original version of this manuscript   url https   arxiv org abs 1412 1481   treated the case where the rank  size  of the LMI defining pencil of the containing spectrahedron is fixed  but the number of variables is not  Subsequently  we and Davidson  Dor-On  Shalit and Solel independently consider inclusion problems for balls  where is fixed  but is not   Our results in this direction appear in Section sec balls  We highly recommend the posting DDSS for its many interesting results  including a far reaching generalization of the symmetry based inclusion result of Proposition prop small g and a fascinating connection with the theory of frames  In addition DDSS extends many spectrahedral inclusion results to the setting of  infinite dimensional  operators   See also Zal which considers the operator setting with an emphasis on the unbounded domains as well as various polynomial Positivstellens  atze   They also show if a tuple of matrices dilates to a commuting tuple of normal operators  then dilates to a commuting tuple of normal matrices satisfying the inclusion In particular  using the  infinite dimensional  optimum bound identified in this article  it follows that given a tuple  finite set  of symmetric contractions  there exists a tuple of commuting symmetric matrices and an isometry such that

Bounds on the Median and the Equipoint of the Beta Distribution
 Like the median  the equipoint is a measure of central tendency in a probability distribution function  PDF   In this section we establish  for the Beta distribution  new lower bound for the median and  by relating the equipoint to the median  bounds on the equipoint needed in the proof of Theorem thm thetaExplicit   median   equipoint   beta distribution  ef pd f varrho  As in Section sec introprob we follow the convention that and consider the Beta distribution supported on  We denote by the probability density function of i e      pdf   salt  alt  x   fra cx   salt-1  1-x    alt-1   B  salt  alt     for  The cumulative distribution function of is defined for  We are interested in the  fmedian  of and in the -  fequipoint  defined by and respectively  Here we used that and are strictly monotonically increasing for  We will continue to use this tacitly throughout this section

New bounds on the median of the beta distribution
 Having a lower bound for the equipoint in terms of the median we now turn our attention to the median of the beta distribution   median   beta distribution  By Lemma reform  a   Simmons  inequality  eqre fineq simm  is equivalent to which is therefore conjectured for all with  Proposition prop extra2 below proves a weakening of  eqre fineq simmc  where an extra factor of is introduced in the second term on the left hand side  Suppose and set  Then  int 0  mu  mu-x    salt-1  1- mu x    alt-1 x dx  int 0  1- mu   mu x    salt-1  1- mu-x    alt-1 x dx
   fra c mu  salt 1- mu   alt   salt  alt   fra c salt  salt alt  alt    salt  alt    salt  alt 1    Reversing the direction of integration in the first integral and changing the domain of integration in the second integral  we get  int 0   mu   mu-x    salt-1  1- mu x    alt-1 x d x	  int 0  mu x   salt-1  1-x    alt-1   mu-x dx

Estimating for Odd

Dilations and Inclusions of Balls
 In this section free relaxations of the problem of including the unit ball of into a spectrahedron are considered  Here the focus is the dependence of the inclusion scale as a function of  rather than  Among the results we identify the worst case inclusion constant as  This inclusion constant can be viewed as a symmetric variable matrix version of the quantitative measure of the difference between the maximal and minimal operator space structures associated with the unit ball in introduced by Paulsen Pau for which the best results give only upper and lower bounds Pisier-book

Four types of balls
 Let  f   denote the unit ball in  Here we consider four matrix convex sets each of which  at level equal  Two of these we know to be free spectrahedra  A third is for but likely not for  The remaining one we will prove is not a free spectrahedron as part of a forthcoming paper 
The OH ball
 The  fOH ball   for operator Hilbert space Pisier-book   f   is the set of tuples of symmetric matrices such that     sum  j 1  g X j 2  preceq I     Equivalently  the row matrix  or its transpose  has norm at most  The ball is symmetric about the origin and also satisfies the conditions of Proposition prop small g  For two variables  the commutability index of is at least  Let    C 1    fra c1   sqr t2   1 	 0

The min and max balls
 Let  f   denote the  fmin ball   the unit ball with the minimum operator system structure   Namely  if     sum  j 1   g  x j X j  preceq I    for all unit vectors  For a tuple of symmetric matrices  the following are equivalent     i   em is in the min ball  em   em for each unit vector the vector   em for every -tuple of symmetric matrices for which  The equivalence of  i  and  ii  is immediate  The tuple is in the min ball if and only if for each pair of unit vectors     sum  j 1  g x j  v   X j v  v  v   1    and the equivalence of  i  and  iii  follows  Now suppose is not in the min ball  In this case there exists such that but of course  Thus  iv  implies  i   If  iv  doesn t hold  then there is a such that but  This latter inclusion implies and it follows that is not in the min ball and  i  implies  iv   Note that is not exactly a free spectrahedron since it is defined by infinitely many linear matrix inequalities  LMIs   In a forthcoming paper we show using the theory of matrix extreme points that in fact is not a free spectrahedron  By comparison  the  fmax ball   denoted  f    is the set of -tuples of symmetric matrices such that for every and -tuple of symmetric matrices for which  Like the min ball  the max ball is not presented as a free spectrahedron since it is defined in terms of infinitely many LMIs  It is described by an LMI when  See Subsection sec spin ball below  The min and max balls are polar dual  polar dual   dual polar  in the following sense  A tuple  resp   if and only if for every  resp   Moreover  if is a -tuple of symmetric matrices and if then  for each     mfBmax g n   subset  cDA n   subset  mfBm g n      Recall that if and only if  Thus if and only if for every  Conversely  if and only if for every such that  equivalently  Now suppose  By definition  if then since  On the other hand  if then  for each unit vector    I   v  v I succeq  v    otimes I   sum X j otimes A j   v   otimes I     sum j  v  X jv  A j     Hence By Lemma lem min alts  iii   is in the min ball  The use of the term   minimal  in   min ball  refers not to the size of the spectrahedron itself  but rather by analogy to its use in the theory of operator spaces Pau  In particular  the min ball is defined  in a sense  in terms of a minimal number of positivity conditions  whereas the max ball is defined in terms of the maximal number of positivity conditions  essentially that it should be contained in every free spectrahedron which  at level is the unit ball   Proposition prop min max duality is a version of the duality between the minimum and maximum operator space structures on a normed vector space Pau
