Circular Free Spectrahedra
 A subset is  fcircular  if implies for all  In this section the first part of Theorem theorem circularmain characterizing circular free spectrahedra is established  The main idea of the proof is as follows  Assuming is a circular free spectrahedron  for each the pencil determines the same free spectrahedron as namely  We are thus in a position to apply the Gleichstellensatz  see e g  and  characterizing when two free spectrahedra are the same  It turns out if  for a such that is irrational  is unitarily equivalent to then is circular  This fact is a corollary of the proof of Theorem theorem circularmain it circ given below  For a direct proof  observe  if then and thus  for a dense set of the tuple is unitarily equivalent to  A routine limiting argument completes the proof   subsectio nSet up for the Proof of Theorem theorem circularmain it circ   Suppose satisfies the hypotheses of the theorem  except for possibly the irreducibility condition  Here  a -tuple is said to be  firreducible  if the have no common reducing subspace  i e  if there is no proper subspace such that and for each  We first present the linear Gleichstellensatz adapted to our set up of free  non-symmetric  variables  If satisfies where is minimal defining for then is unitarily equivalent to for some -tuple  ef cD D mathscr D  The statement holds when working over the field of real numbers and evaluating at tuples of symmetric matrices by and  It is easy to see that the same proofs work over the field of complex numbers and evaluating at tuples of self-adjoint matrices  We now reduce the proposition to this case  To each monic pencil in free variables we can associate a monic pencil with self-adjoint coefficients in self-adjoint variables as follows  Let and for  Then     cL    pre A  pim A   y z   I -  sum  j 1  g  pre A j y j -  sum  j 1  g  pim A j z j     Each yields a point in the free spectrahedron  in self-adjoint variables   Conversely  given we have  Hence implies that  We claim that is a minimal defining pencil for  Indeed  as otherwise by the Gleichstellensatz  or   there will be a reducing subspace for and a compression of to this subspace with  But this in turn will yield a subpencil of with the same free spectrahedron as contradicting the minimality of  Hence  again by the Gleichstellensatz  is  unitarily equivalent to  a subpencil of  But then is a subpencil of B  as desired  Since  for each and are minimal defining tuples for the free spectrahedron by Proposition prop Gsatz for each there is a unitary such that  for each  beq U t  A s U t  e  it A s   eeq For a fixed equation  eqre feq UAUe  holds for each real so the spectrum of is a circular set for each  Since each is finite dimensional  the spectrum of each is and each is nilpotent  Fix a number relatively irrational with respect to  For notational ease  abbreviate  for this  Being unitary  the matrix can be  block  diagonalized as    U W  DW    where is diagonal and is unitary  Equation  eqre feq UAUe  shows    D  WA sW  D e  it WA sW      Clearly  and define the same free spectrahedron  Thus  without loss of generality  may be taken to have the form  beq U    mbda 1 I  m 1  oplus mbda 2 I  m 2   oplus  cdots  oplus mbda  k 1  I  m  k 1      eeq where the are distinct unimodular numbers  Let denote the corresponding eigenspace of and let the be identity matrices on these spaces  Since we can use this orthogonal sum to give a block decomposition  beq A s  A s j  ell    j  ell    eeq subordinate to the  Note that  beq  overlin e  j    ell A s j  ell    e  i t  A s j  ell   qquad  eeq so it follows that  beq   ell   e  i t   j  qquad or  qquad A s j  ell  0       for all s   eeq Equation  eqre feq dicot  implies for each and  Let be a unitary with the form of equation  eqre feq ublock  and let be a -tuple of matrices with block decomposition as described in equation  eqre feq Asblock   Assume there is a relatively irrational with respect to such that for all s  Given if and if then  by equation  eqre feq dicot    Likewise  if and if then  Moreover  if is a nonzero location  then  for and and all the matrices and are both zero  Fix and note from equation  eqre feq dicot  that if and are both not zero  then and  In particular   Since the are distinct it follows that  Similarly if and are both not zero  then equation shows hence  Given a family of matrices with the block decomposition a sequence of pairs from the set of the form  beq  cC     j 0 j 1   j 1 j 2   j 2 j 3   ots   j m j  m 1      eeq such that for each there is an such that is an  fadmissible chain   Call the left end of and denote by the subspace  beq  cS  cC   cS  j 0   oplus  cS  j 1   oplus  cS  j 2   oplus  cdots  oplus  cS  j  m 1     eeq The family has a  fblock zero

as in  eqre feq chain   then the are distinct  em The family has a block zero column  Suppose is a chain as in  eqre feq chain   but the are not distinct  Since for all and in this case we may assume that and and for  By reindexing if needed  we may assume that     cC    m 1   1 2   2 3   ots   m-1 m      is an admissible chain  Summarizing  for each there exists an such that and there exists an such that  Equation  eqre feq dicot  implies for each Thus must be both and  Hence is a multiple of contradicting the choice of as relatively irrational with respect to and the proof of item it distinct is complete  Turning to item it blockzero and arguing by contradiction  suppose for each there exists a and an so that  In this case  since  by Lemma lem atmostone each column and row has exactly one nonzero entry and since all diagonal entries of are zero  there is an and distinct indices such that     cC    j 0 j  m     j  m  j  m-1    ots   j 2 j 1    j 1 j 0      is an admissible chain  An application of item it distinct concludes the proof  The following lemma completes the set up for the proof of Theorem theorem circularmain it circ  Assume the set up and hypotheses of Lemma

On the other hand  by the choice of  It follows that Thus is a common   invariant  subspace for the  On the other hand  since  for each the location is a nonzero location  Lemma lem atmostone shows for all and all  Finally  the existence of a and an such that contradicts the maximality of the chain  Hence for all such and all  It follows that is also a common invariant subspace for the  Hence is reducing  Items  2  and  3  follow immediately from item  1  and the definition of irreducible   subsectio nProof of Theorem theorem circularmain it circ   The initial set up of the proof shows that

 We write for the monoid freely generated by and i e   consists of   words  in the noncommuting letters  including the   empty word  which plays the role of the identity   Let denote the associative -algebra freely generated by and i e   the elements of are polynomials in the freely noncommuting variables and with coefficients in  Its elements are called   free polynomials   The   involution  on extends the complex conjugation on satisfies reverses the order of words  and acts -linearly on polynomials  Polynomials fixed under this involution are   symmetric   The length of the longest word in a free polynomial is the   degree  of and is denoted by or if  The set of all words of degree at most is and is the vector space of all free polynomials of degree at most  Fix positive integers and    Free matrix polynomials  - elements of   i e   matrices with entries from - will play a role in what follows  Elements of are represented as  beq p x   sum  w  in ngle x x    rangle  B w w x   in  C   ell mes v  ngle x x    rangle  eeq where the sum is finite  and runs over words in and  The involution extends to matrix polynomials by    p x     sum  w  in ngle x  x    rangle  B  w    w x     in  C  v mes  ell  ngle x x    rangle     If and we say is symmetric  Additionally if we say is  fmonic   looseness -1 If is a free polynomial and then the evaluation is defined in the natural way by replacing by by and sending the empty word to the appropriately sized identity matrix  Such evaluations produce  all  finite dimensional -representations of the algebra of free polynomials  Polynomial evaluations extend to matrix polynomials by evaluating entrywise  That is  if is as in  eqre feq freepolydef   then    p X   sum  w  in ngle x x    rangle  B w  otimes w X   in C   ell mes v  otimes M n  C      Note that if is symmetric and then is a self-adjoint matrix 
Invariant Polynomials
 In this subsection we prove Theorem theorem invarpolyintro stated below in a self contained fashion for the reader s convenience  Write to indicate the matrices and are unitarily equivalent  Suppose is a monic free matrix polynomial  For each and for each -tuple of unitaries there exists a unitary such that for all    p U 1  X 1U 1  ots U g   X g U g   W   p X 1  ots X g  W    if and only if  beq p x  simu p 1 x 1   oplus  cdots  oplus p g x g    eeq i e   is  up to unitary equivalence  a direct sum of univariate matrix polynomials  The following lemma is needed in the proof of Theorem theorem invarpoly  Suppose is a free matrix polynomial  where  beq p i x i  p j  x j   p i x i    p j  x j   p i x i p j  x j     0  eeq whenever  Then there exists a unitary such that  beq U  p x U   ha tp  1  x 1   oplus  cdots  oplus  ha tp  g x g    eeq for some free matrix polynomials each in the variables alone  Suppose  eqre feq 62  holds whenever  Using the notation to denote words in and write   p i  x i   sum  w i  A  w i  w i  x i     Then  beq p i  x i  p j x j    sum  w i w j  A  w i  A  w j  w i  x i  w j  x j  0   eeq Note that  if are words in and respectively  then we have if and only if and  This implies that each monomial appears on the right hand side of  eqre feq long  exactly once  It follows that for all whenever  Similarly   beq p i  x i    p j x j    sum  w i w j  A  w i    A  w j  w i  x i    w j  x j  0   eeq Since each monomial appears on the right hand side of  eqre feq longadjoint  exactly once  it follows that for all whenever  Furthermore   beq p i  x i  p j x j      sum  w i w j  A  w i  A  w j    w i  x i  w j  x j    0   eeq It follows that for all whenever  Let denote the finite dimensional  non-unital  -algebra generated by    A  w j   w j  mathr m  is   a   word   in     x j x j       Then  beq  cA j  cA  ell    0  quad for   eeq Decompose as a direct sum of invariant  hence reducing  subspaces for say     C d   cS 1 oplus  cdots oplus  cS m  oplus  cS

We can repeat the above consideration -- decomposing into a direct sum of reducing subspaces for etc  Tracking down all these decompositions yields the desired block form  eqre feq Ublock    Proof of Theorem theorem invarpoly   Let be a -tuple of noncommuting letters and suppose is a monic free matrix polynomial that is invariant under coordinate unitary conjugation  Here is given by  Call a monomial a  noncommutative  cross term if it contains a product of the form or or or where  Our immediate goal is to show that does not have any cross terms  To this end  let be the set of all cross term monomials and define the free matrix polynomials and by  beq p   mathrm ncr    x   sum  w x   notin  cC x  B w w x    quad  quad  quad  quad p   mathrm cr    x   sum  w x   in  cC x  B w w x    eeq Here and  With this notation   beq p x  p   mathrm ncr    x  p   mathrm cr    x    eeq To show has no cross terms we will show  Define by    ld ex  1  x 1  oplus 0  oplus  cdots  oplus 0   quad ld ex  2 0  oplus x 2  oplus  cdots oplus 0   quad ld ex  g 0 oplus  cdots oplus 0 oplus x g     Choose permutation matrices so that for all  Recall the canonical shuffle discussed before Lemma lem lambdaball  We use it again here dealing with polynomials  Namely  if is a free matrix polynomial then the notation means that for all and for all there exists a matrix that is a product of direct sums of canonical shuffles such that  Consider  Since whenever we see that    q x  p ld ex    cs q 1  x 1   oplus ots  oplus q g  x g     where the are monic matrix polynomials each depending only on and  Furthermore     p U 1   ld ex  1 U 1  ots  U g   ld ex  g U g   simu p x   oplus p 0   oplus ots  oplus p 0   p x   oplus I  d g-1    sum w  B w  oplus 0  d g-1    w x      Fix and consider the evaluations and on -tuples of matrices  By assumption there exists a unitary depending only on our permutation matrices and on such that  beq V n   q X  V n p  U 1  otimes I n    ld eX  1  U 1  otimes I n   ots   U g  otimes I n    ld eX  g  U g  otimes I n    p X  oplus I  nd g-1    eeq for all  Define the matrix by for  Here the are commuting variables and is called a generic matrix  Define the -tuple of matrices by  We say a word in the commuting letters and is a commutative cross term if it contains a product of the form or with  Then  eqre feq qpequality  is equivalent to  beq V n   q  cX n  V n p  cX n  oplus I  nd g-1     eeq We next show that the entries of have no commutative cross terms  Since contains no cross terms it follows that for all the entries of contain no commutative cross terms  Furthermore  the entries of are linear combinations of the entries of so it follows that for all the entries of contain no commutative cross terms  Using  eqre feq qpGenericEquality  we conclude that for all the entries of and hence the entries of of contain no commutative cross terms  Since the entries of have no commutative cross terms we know from equation  eqre feq pCRpNCRform  that the entries of have no commutative cross terms  If a monomial is not a cross term  then none of the entries of are commutative cross terms  Therefore none of the entries of are commutative cross terms  Since has no commutative cross terms this implies that none the entries of cannot be commutative cross terms  We conclude and therefore  beq p   ncr    cX n  p  cX n    eeq Equation  eqre feq pNCRisp  holds for all so we obtain that for all and for all -tuples of matrices we have the equality  beq p  mathr mncr   X  p X    eeq Since equation  eqre feq pNCRisspEval  holds for all we conclude  beq p  mathr mncr   x  p x    eeq Therefore  has no cross terms  as claimed  Now can be written where  Additionally  since is invariant under coordinate unitary conjugation it follows that defined by  beq p 2  x  I 2 sum i p i x   sum  i j  p i  x i  p j  x j   eeq is also invariant under coordinate unitary conjugation and hence cannot have any cross terms  Thus equation  eqre feq coordinvarsquared  implies that whenever  Additionally  since is invariant under coordinate unitary conjugation  given any unitaries there exists some unitary depending only on the such that for any we have  beq p X 1  ots X g  U  p U   1 X 1 U 1  ots U   g X g U g  U   eeq It immediately follows that  beq p X 1  ots X g    U   p U 1   X 1 U 1  ots  U g   X g U g    U   eeq These two equations imply  beq p x   p x  I  sum i p i x   sum i p i x     sum  i j  p i  x i    p j  x j  
 p x p x    I  sum i p i x   sum i p i x     sum  i j  p i  x i  p j  x j   
  eeq are also invariant under coordinate unitary conjugation and therefore have no cross terms  Therefore whenever  It follows from Lemma that there exists a unitary such that    V   p x  V   ha tp  1  x 1   oplus  cdots  oplus  ha tp  g x g      where the are monic free matrix polynomials in the variable  Thus  if is invariant under coordinate unitary conjugation  then equation  eqre feq invarpoly  holds  The converse is straightforward  If  eqre feq invarpoly  holds  then evidently is invariant under coordinate unitary conjugation  We say a free spectrahedron is invariant under coordinate unitary conjugation if implies for all and all unitaries  Suppose the symmetric monic linear pencil is minimal in defining a free spectrahedron  It follows from Theorem theorem invarpoly and that is invariant under coordinate unitary conjugation if and only if there is a unitary so that    U   L A x  U  oplus  j 1  g  I-A j x j-A jx j        appendix
