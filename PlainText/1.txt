The direction in rh3 immediately follows from rh2  To prove the opposite direction  it suffices to show that if names are equivalent then  Assume that  By definition forces  Then  as are equivalent  also forces  It follows that as required   bpri  midg  If then let and   zzidga     name idga    Then is a full regular double-name and for any generic set   the  tidentity    name  ri  fDouble-name representation theorem   sdnr  The next theorem shows that the double-name tool adequately represents the case of a pair of generic sets such that   mGG  Assume that   are   generic sets over   and    Then there is a full regular double-name   such that   and    If then it suffices to define by  Therefore assume that  Then there exist conditions and incompatible in  By a basic forcing theorem  there exist names such that and every condition satisfies while every condition satisfies  It is not true immediately that   we need to somewhat modify the names by shrinking  We can wlog assume that

that is generic and   then and  We claim that and still and   mGGle  If   is an   generic set and then    Similarly if   is an   generic set and then    By construction  Consider any so that there is

by the lemma  Therefore is generic and by the definition of  Thus is generic and by construction  This is forced by some  On the other hand  as there exists some  We can assume that  Then too  by the regularity assumption  and hence and  We conclude that by the lemma  Finally   this ends the verification of dq dq1 for  Thus  In addition  by the choice of and some forces that    is generic and     Then and as above  Similarly we have  To fix the regularity condition of the theorem  let   then still and is regular  by Lemma rh  It is not necessarily true  of course  that sets and are dense  To fix this shortcoming  we define and let where The set is dense in by construction  We claim that  Indeed let be an generic set  Then  But    Case 1      Then since if and then are incompatible by the original choice of  We also have by obvious reasons  It follows that and hence is an generic set and because  In particular so that as above    Case 2     similar    Case 3      Then as above  It follows that  Thus indeed the set is open dense in   and the arguments above  Case 1  also imply that  Moreover  inherits the regularity of   fExtensions   sext   extension   md e  Suppose that are

as required  0ext3 To check dq dq1  a  for some consider any generic set containing and extend it to a generic set so that  The  generic by Lemma io  sets and satisfy by 0ext1  On the other hand hence is generic  as required  The verification of dq dq1  b  also is very simple   merh  In   assume that    Then  aerh1  if   and   then    aerh2  therefore if   and   then    aerh3  if   is regular and   then   is regular  too  erh1 Suppose that  ie  and there is a condition which forces that  Prove that also forces  Let a set be a set generic over and containing   prove that  The set is generic by Lemma 0ext and still hence as required  erh3 Assume that and forces   we have to prove that  As it suffices to show that  The same argument based on Lemma 0ext shows that also forces  Therefore since

r3ext  is a   s increasing sequence in   then   belongs to    a3ext2  therefore the set   is    Om closed in the sense of    a3ext3  if   is a strictly   s increasing sequence in   then the double-name   belongs to    3ext1 Suppose that is a strictly increasing sequence of ordinals and double-names form a strictly s increasing sequence  if then and  Let and  We claim that  Let s verify dq dq1  Assume that is a generic set containing some   we have to prove that is generic and  Note first of all that each set is        xi  generic by the product forcing theorem  and belongs to some  We can assume that  otherwise simply cut all double-names  Then therefore for all  It follows that each set is        xi  generic  and by Lemma io  And as we conclude that at least is a filter in and that is  dq dq1  b    k Further  the sets satisfy  It follows that belongs to some and then there is a condition with which        za  forces that so that  We can assume that  otherwise simply cut all double-names  Then and also by Lemma 0ext 0ext3 for each  It follows from by definition that each set is        xi  generic and    To continue with dq dq1  a   we prove the genericity of  Let be a dense subset of in  Assume towards the contrary that  Then there is a condition which forces that  Then for some and there is a condition which puts in in the sense that  As is dense  there is some with  Then belongs to some  By Corollary qq  there is a condition compatible with and such that  Then forces while a compatible condition  forces the opposite  which is a contradiction   k Consider an arbitrary        eta  generic set containing hence  as well  Then  as the set is        eta  generic and by Lemma io  Moreover  by Lemma 0ext the sets and are        xi  generic  and  However by construction  hence by the choice of  Thus as well  Now consider an generic set with   then  The set satisfies therefore and hence contrary to the choice of and  This ends the proof of the genericity of and dq dq1  a      k Finally to establish dq dq3b it suffices to define a generic set such that and  Recall that  As there is a       0  generic set containing and such that  Following an argument above  consider a        generic set with  Then and by construction    3ext3 Pretty similar argument   in    mresq  Assume that    Then  aresq1  the set   is a club in    aresq2  if   is full      Definition fn   then is a club  aresq3  if   is unbounded in   then   resq1 That is closed follows from Lemma 3ext 3ext1  To prove that is unbounded  let and find a larger ordinal  Recall that to decide a sentence means to force or to force  By basic forcing theorems  if then the set is dense in therefore by the ccc property of there is an ordinal such that is dense in for all  Then  resq2 easily follows from resq1  To prove resq3 apply Lemma erh erh3   fSuperpositions   ssus  Assume that and  Define  zztaclef     zztacrig     zzac     superposition ac    and   msus1  If   and   then   and    Assume that  Then there is a pair with  By definition there is a condition such that and  Then and hence  To prove the converse assume that  Then there is a pair with and further there is a pair with  Then witnesses that and hence   msus1c  Assume that   and    If   are equivalent  in the sense of Definition eqn  then so are   and     msus2  If   and   then the following are equivalent    1        2        3    Let  To prove  3  consider an generic set and let  Then hence is an generic set by Lemma io  As  It follows that is an generic set  Finally by Lemma sus1  This argument also proves that  Thus  That is obvious   msus3  If   and   is full    in the sense of Definition fn  then    By Lemma fnd  Now use Lemma sus2  Thus if is a full double-name then is a map  In this case  consider the  tinverse  double-name  double-name inverse     zzc-1    let and compare with  On the one hand  we have for any generic set by Lemma sus1  It follows that since the successive action of and is the identity by Lemma io  Similarly  Therefore and are equivalent  and hence by Lemma rh but generally speaking we cannot assert that straightforwardly  To fix this problem  define the modified action   zzac      superposition ac      mc c  Let   and let   be a full double-name  If   is regular  that is   then   is regular  and    That follows from Corollary sus3  The regularity holds by Lemma rh  To prove note that both and are regular double-names  and hence it suffices  by Lemma rh to prove that and are equivalent  However  still by Lemma rh is equivalent to and is equivalent to hence overall is equivalent to by Corollary sus1c  Finally is equivalent to see above   mcles  Assume that   and   are full double-names  and    Then  acles1  if   then    acles2  if   are regular then   iff    cles1 is clear since is monotone on both and  As for cles2 the implication holds by cles1 and Lemma erh while to prove the inverse make use of Lemma c c   fGeneric double-names and product forcing   sgnpf  By Lemma 3ext we can consider the set ordered by as an  Om closed forcing notion in  s bigger double-names are stronger conditions   Suppose that is a generic set over  Then a

Then    agga1  it holds in   that   belongs to    agga2  if   is   generic over   and   then   is   generic over   and    agga3  if   and   then   and    gga1 Remark gnar allows simply to refer to Lemma 3ext  gga2 Make use of Lemma io  gga3 To prove that and refer to Lemma 0ext 0ext3  To prove that note that by Lemma 3ext there is some which decides each to belong or not to belong to   then   k The corollary obviously refers to the product forcing  Yet it will be more convenient to consider a certain subforcing of  m lsp d  A double-name is  tcompatible  if  Let be the set of all compatible

Lemma 0ext 0ext1  On the other hand  there is such that hence and  It follows that as required  To prove assume to the contrary that a pair forces that contains no pairs in but  Let be the least satisfying  We can assume that as otherwise can be extended by Lemma ext1  Note that forces that   As otherwise there is a stronger which forces hence and contrary to the choice of   The set is generic as above  and contains and hence  However and by Lemma 0ext so that which contradicts the contrary assumption     fThe first ingredient   sgna  Generic double-names and forcing with enable us to carry out the first main step towards Theorem mt  In let be the set of all sets such that the transitive closure has cardinality strictly   mass1  Thus suppose that is a generic  zzG0    set over let  zzXc    and it is true in that is a countable   non-empty set of sets of reals  There is a formula with some  zzphi    as the only parameter  such that it is true in that is the only set satisfying  There is a sequence of names  zzud     zzUn    such that  Each can be assumed to be an name of a set of reals  that is  in where is the set of all names for reals  Furthermore  according to the  Om cc property of the forcing each name for a real can be assumed to be a set in  Therefore we shall wlog assume that for all  Anyway there is a condition   which  zzp-    forces over that    is the only set satisfying   and is a set of sets of reals    Let be the least ordinal satisfying  zzga-     Let a  bp  tpair  be any pair  zzp-pair  -pair   pair zzp-pair  -pair  such that and forces that where   bre  mppe  Let  Then is a  bp pair  forces that   ere  mlsp  Let   be a    bp pair   There is a double-name   such that   and   is a    bp pair  If where then to define add to all pairs such that already  We claim that is a    bp pair  Indeed if is generic then easily     hence  Further by construction  Finally forces that because so does and we can replace by since  If then still for some  Use Lemma ext1 to get a double-name with and argue as in the first case   m1mt  Suppose that   is a   generic set over   and   is a    bp pair  Then    a1mt1  and   is   generic over    a1mt2  --- in other words  any    bp pair   forces   over    1mt1 To prove the genericity apply Corollary gga  To prove 1mt2 suppose otherwise  Then there is a pair in with which forces that is  arl  if is a generic set over   containing and then  Let be an elementary submodel of a large model  such that and belong to in and is an elementary submodel of  vrt  all formulas  Let be the Mostowski collapse of   still in  Note that is a transitive model of Zermelo with choice  and the collapse map is the identity on hence even on  In particular  for all and even  By the elementary submodel property  still forces over that --- that is  acl  if is a generic set over   containing and then  To infer a contradiction  note that since in by Lemma 3ext there exists a set generic over   and containing hence containing as well  We underline that and then belongs to too  Let be a set generic over hence over as well  and containing and then containing  Then the set is generic over and over by Lemma io and in addition  by cl  Recall that also belongs to  Therefore by 1mt1  Thus and are generic sets over and both contain is the only set satisfying in while is the only set satisfying in  However  because and   while on the other hand which is a contradiction   fStabilizing pairs and second ingredient   ssimt  Let a  tstabilizing  bp pair  be any  bp pair  zzp-pair  -pair stabilizing   pair zzp-pair  -pair stabilizing  which  for some   forces   over     mmt1c  If   is an   generic set over   containing   then there is a stabilizing    bp pair   with    Let see Remark ppe  Let be a set generic over and containing so that is generic  Let  Then the set satisfies by Theorem 1mt  Therefore there is a number such that  Then there is a stronger pair  and  which forces    We can assume that is a  bp pair  by Lemma lsp   mmt1d  Let be a stabilizing    bp pair  Assume that   are sets   generic over   and containing   and    Then    By definition  and for one and the same  The second ingredient in the proof of Theorem mt will be the following   mmt2  Assume that   is a stabilizing    bp pair  are   generic sets over   containing   and    Then    Let s show how this implies Theorem mt  The proof of Theorem mt2 itself will follow in the next sections  We argue in the assumptions and notation of ass1  Let so that by ass1  Then by Corollary mt1c there is a stabilizing  bp pair such that  Pick such that and  Consider  in the set of all sets generic over and satisfying and  In particular  The only essential parameter of the definition of which is not immediately   --- is  However itself  as basically any subset of any is   in the Solovay model  We conclude that is   in  On the other hand  suppose that  Then by Theorem mt2  Therefore the set can be defined as for some   every  This witnesses that is   in because so is by the above  Thus the set contains a   element  It follows that contains an   element  by Lemma mtl as required   FThm mt mod Thm mt2    fFinal   smod  Here we prove Theorem mt2 and finally prove Theorem mt   zzzz   separate index for Section mod  |se ebelow     We argue in the assumptions and notation of Theorem mt2   That is   amod1  is a stabilizing

In this assumption  we have to prove that  Working towards this goal  our plan will be to find   a   sets  r   generic over containing and satisfying where and   then the products and will be generic over and containing so that follows by Proposition mt1d accomplishing the proof of Theorem mt2  By Theorem GG there is a double-name   in such that    zzC     double-name C     amod2  is full   rmod2  and   k --- and we can assume that each condition forces that while each condition forces that    As we can further assume that  amod3  the restricted double-name  rmod3  coincides with of Example idg so that is full and regular  and for all  Let be any set with generic over   zzGa     zzzzGa    Then in by Corollary gga  zzA     zzzzA    and since   aresr1  The set    rresr   zzXYZ     zzzzXYZ    is a club in   and if   then   is regular  aresr2  the set    rresr  C res is a club in    aresr3  therefore   is a club  and in addition   To prove resr1 and resr2 apply Corollary resq   the unboundedness condition in resq resq3 follows from the genericity of and the density of the set of all regular double-names by Lemma rh rh2  Claim in resr3 follows from mod3  Now suppose that hence is full  Let be regular  Define  see Section sus   m1gen  The map   is a   s preserving bijection of the set   onto itself  satisfying     zzDNYreg     zzzzDNYreg    If and then belongs to and is regular by Lemma c c hence  If is a bigger ordinal still in and then iff by Lemma cles cles2  Finally holds still by Lemma c c because  that is   by mod2  In particular  if then and hence is a regular double-name  Thus is a s increasing sequence of regular double-names  The following is a key fact   m2gen  The sequence   is generic over   in the sense that if a set   is open dense in   then there is an ordinal   such that    The set belongs to and still is dense in by Lemma rh rh2  Therefore its Cimage still belongs to and is dense in by Lemma 1gen  It follows by the genericity of that for some  Then since by Lemma 1gen   m3gen  The set    zzGap     zzzzGap    is   generic over    Let us check the other intended properties of as in    To see that recall that  It follows by Corollary gga gga3 that  However by Corollary resr resr3  We conclude that  Finally since by mod3  Thus as required  Finally prove that where and   zzAp     zzzzAp    It suffices to show that if then However by construction and on the other hand for all by Lemma sus1 therefore  5  is equivalent to which obviously follows from and this is a corollary of the equality in mod2 by Lemma 0ext 0ext1  b    DTheorem

remains to note that Caicedo and Ketchersid cai obtained a somewhat similar trichotomy result in in a strong determinacy assumption
