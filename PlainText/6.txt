Introduction
 Our aim is to initiate the study of local spectral transfer for Weil s metaplectic covering over a local field of characteristic zero  To begin with  let us explain the ideas by reviewing the case of reductive groups 
Review of the reductive case

Metaplectic coverings
 As is well-known  certain coverings of connected reductive groups play a prominent rôle in the study of automorphic representations and arithmetic  Let be local as before and fix an additive character of  Our basic example is Weil s metaplectic covering of where is a symplectic -vector space of dimension  It is a central extension 1 o  bmu 8 o ld eG   xrightarro w rev  G F  o 1 
  bmu 8     z  in  C  mes  z 8   1  of locally compact groups  It is customary to use instead  but the enlarged version  obtained by push-forward via  in preferred in this article  Its global avatar is crucial in understanding the Siegel modular forms of half-integral weights  In a harmonic analyst s eyes  the upshot is to investigate em the irreducible admissible representations of which are genuine  meaning that for all   em the anti-genuine test functions on meaning that   em the orbital integrals of anti-genuine test functions  Furthermore  we have to consider the inverse images under of Levi subgroups of as well  hereafter called Levi subgroups of  Thanks to the choice of eightfold coverings  they take the form with called the coverings of metaplectic type  For the rudiments of harmonic analysis on general coverings  see Li12b  Our long-term goal is to bring into Langlands  formalism  The first requirement seems to be a reasonable theory of endoscopy for together with transfer  fundamental lemma and a partial stabilization of the trace formula as a reality check  Based upon prior works by Adams and Renard in the case such a theory has been proposed in Li11  Roughly speaking  folk wisdom suggests a close relation between and the split as exemplified by the -correspondence for the dual pair with being a -dimensional quadratic -space  Accordingly  one may imagine that the dual group of   is    These definitions have evident generalizations to coverings of metaplectic type  The precise formalism will be reviewed in  Ssec endoscopy  For the impatient reader  the recipe is simply to replace by  passage to coverings  and by  passage to anti-genuine orbital integrals  in all the foregoing discussions  The elliptic endoscopic data are in bijection with pairs with with  The transfer of orbital integrals and the fundamental lemma still hold true in this setup  The stabilization of the elliptic terms of the Arthur-Selberg trace formula is established in Li15 which in turn relies on the invariant trace formula established in Li14b for a more general class of coverings 
Main ingredients
 The next stage is to undertake the spectral transfer for  We shall take our lead from Ar96  The first step is to set up the spectral parameters and regard as functions on the relevant spaces  On the endoscopic side  we form the space of endoscopic spectral parameters by taking the disjoint union of discrete series -parameters of each  Doing the same construction for every Levi subgroup we define where  As to the side of a reasonable choice is to take the genuine tempered spectrum  However  Arthur s formalism in Ar93 is to work with a space of virtual genuine tempered characters of derived from Knapp-Stein theory  that is better-suited for the study of orthogonality questions  cf   for the case of coverings  Note that there are parallel constructions for the geometric parameters  i e   conjugacy and stable conjugacy classes  To begin with  assume non-archimedean  Let stand for the image of  By the trace Paley-Wiener theorem  elements in  resp   may be regarded as certain -valued functions on  resp    these spaces of functions are called Paley-Wiener spaces  The desideratum is an equality of the form f  EndoE  phi     sum   au  in T - lde G     Delta  phi  au  f   lde G   au    quad  phi  in T  EndoE ld eG   for suitably spectral transfer factors where  This is our Main Theorem prop character-relation reinterpreted as in Remark rem character-relation-equiv  The approach in Ar94 may be rephrased as follows  em An element is called cuspidal if it vanishes off the elliptic locus  There is a similar notion on the endoscopic side  and geometric transfer preserves cuspidality  em Characterize the image of under   this is a technical tour de force  em It is straightforward to obtain  eqre feqn desideratum  for cuspidal and spectral parameters with uniquely determined spectral transfer factors  The upshot is to extend  eqre feqn desideratum  to all   the case of non-elliptic will then follow by the compatibility of geometric transfer with parabolic induction  together with recurrence on  As a consequence  we can also characterize the full image of  Corollary prop transfer-surj  In the last step we invoke a local-global argument based on the simple stable trace formula for in Li15  Equation  eqre feqn desideratum  may also be seen as a description of the image of  as a linear functional on  under the dual of  This is what we mean by local character relations  In this Introduction  we cannot explain in depth the basic ideas of proof  or even the relevant definitions  Nonetheless  we point out below a few differences between the present work and Arthur s  em For the covering the geometric transfer fundamental lemma and the simple stable trace formula are surely highly non-trivial  Fortunately  they are already dealt with in Li11 Li15  em To characterize the geometric transfer of cuspidal genuine orbital integrals  we proceed as in Ar96 via Harish-Chandra s technique of descent  For this is the technical core of Li11 and eventually we are reduced to a similar characterization of the images of em standard endoscopic transfer for classical groups  em non-standard endoscopic transfer for the datum both on the level of Lie algebras  For the first case  we may reuse Arthur s results in Ar96 with minor improvements  The second case is even simpler  since non-standard endoscopic transfer is bijective by its very definition  Cf  the proof of Theorem prop transfer-cusp-surj  em Recall that the spectral parameters in are built as a disjoint union over conjugacy classes of Levi subgroups of   they are essentially the discrete series -parameters of elliptic endoscopic groups of  But one can also go the other way around  consider as a Levi subgroup of some elliptic endoscopic group of  The situation is conveniently represented by Such endoscopic data together with embeddings  up to conjugacy  can be parametrized by a finite set   we will write if it is parametrized by  In contrast with the case of reductive groups  passing from the route to introduces a twist by some in geometric transfer  Lemma prop z s   This phenomenon is inherent in the endoscopy for since the correspondence of conjugacy classes has a twist by  We have to take care of these subtle twists throughout this article  Note that are essentially certain sign factors  their effect might be compared with the central signs in Waldspurger s work Wa91 for  em The local-global argument is more delicate for coverings  One potential problem is that on an adélic covering it is not so straightforward to extract the local component of a rational element where is a sufficiently large set of places  Moreover  a priori it is unclear if two conjugate elements in have conjugate local components  whenever the latter make sense  The question has been studied in Li14a for general coverings  here we need some input from the Weil representation of  Cf   the proof of Proposition prop non-vanishing  One obvious defect is that we have no formula for  Hopefully this will be treated in a sequel to this article  New techniques will be needed 
The archimedean case
 The case has been considered by Adams Ad98 for the principal endoscopic datum and Renard Re98 Re99 in a somewhat different framework  In this article  we will rephrase their results and establish the spectral transfer as identities f  EndoE  phi     sum   pi  in  Pi   temp -  ld eG     Delta  phi   pi  f   lde G    pi    quad  phi  in T  EndoE ld eG   for certain spectral transfer factors cf    eqre feqn desideratum   A striking result  Theorem prop Li-lifting-real  is that for discrete series -parameters the factor are certain natural generalizations of the central signs in Waldspurger s work Wa91 for the case  Following Shelstad s approach Sh08 we will define the adjoint spectral transfer factors and establish the relevant inversion formulas  Theorem prop spectral-inversion-R and Corollary prop spectral-inverted-transfer  for and where is an explicitly defined set of genuine limits of discrete series  the awkward notation means   lifted from    for some elliptic endoscopic group  This is surely just the first step  A simple yet important observation is that inversion can be achieved without the -group machinery in Sh08

The central extension

Weil s metaplectic covering
 Let be a field of characteristic  By a symplectic -vector space we mean a pair where is a finite dimensional -vector space  and is a non-degenerate alternating bilinear form  A maximal totally isotropic subspace  i e   on which is identically zero  of is called a Lagrangian usually denoted by  Define This actually defines a semisimple -group  Assume henceforth that is a local field of characteristic zero  so that becomes a locally compact group  Fix a non-trivial additive character  In this article  Weil s metaplectic covering is a central extension  covering metaplectic  1 o  bmu 8 o  Mp W   xrightarro w rev   Sp W  o 1 of locally compact groups  This covering is non-linear  i e   does not come from a central extension of -groups  unless  We will identify as a subgroup of  Since the symplectic -vector spaces are classified up to isomorphism by their dimension  say we will occasionally write instead  If as symplectic -vector spaces  there is then a canonical homomorphism such that em em covers the natural embedding
Covering groups in general
 Consider a connected reductive -group together with a central extension of locally compact groups 1 o  bmu m o ld eG   xrightarro w rev  G F  o 1 where  These data form a covering group and there is an evident notion of isomorphisms between coverings  By parabolic  resp  Levi  subgroups of we mean the inverse images of parabolic  resp  Levi  subgroups of  The objects living on will be systematically decorated with a such as   we also write in that case  If is a subset of we will denote  We say that an element of is semisimple  regular  etc   if its image in is  Note that acts on by conjugation  we will denote this action by for all  em The notions of functions  orbital integrals  smooth and admissible representations  etc   make sense on   see Li12b  Note that when is archimedean  is a group in Harish-Chandra class   our notions of parabolic and Levi subgroups of are also consistent with the usual ones  em A function or more generally where is a subset of is called anti-genuine if It is called genuine if we require instead  em A representation of is called genuine if It is called anti-genuine if we require instead  em A distribution  regarded as a linear functional  is called genuine if for all we have where  It is called anti-genuine if we require instead  em We use the subscript  resp   to denote the genuine  resp  anti-genuine  objects  For example  denotes the space of anti-genuine functions on whereas denotes the space of irreducible admissible representations of up to equivalence  em Note that a genuine distribution is completely determined by its restriction on  The character of is a genuine distribution  as expected  em The character is actually locally and smooth on   for non-archimedean we have local character expansions around each semisimple element in terms of Fourier transforms of unipotent orbital integrals  This is Harish-Chandra s celebrated regularity theorem for characters  at least when is archimedean or when  For non-archimedean the corresponding result for coverings is proved in  In broad terms  the study of harmonic analysis on is the study of its genuine representations  Denote by  resp   the spaces of strongly regular  resp  strongly regular and elliptic  semisimple classes in  They are equipped with natural maps whose fibers are acted upon by thus there is an evident notion of genuine anti-genuine functions  Finally  suppose that a Haar measure on is chosen  Define the Haar measure on by requiring that  mes ld eE      mes E  for every measurable subset of  Consequently  for every function which factors through we have whenever it is integrable 
The Weil representation and its character
 For a chosen the covering group carries a special genuine representation called the Weil representation or the oscillator representation  It admits various realizations  such as the Schrödinger model  lattice model  mixed model  etc  We refer to MVW87 for details  We fix a Haar measure on hence a Haar measure on by the recipe  eqre feqn measure   The representation decomposes canonically into called the even and odd parts of respectively  Each piece is an irreducible admissible unitarizable representation of  It follows that the character as a genuine distribution on is locally and smooth on  So is  In fact  is smooth on the larger dense open subset This result is originally due to Maktouf  who gave an elegant formula for over  The reader may consult for a summary  In the literature  the metaplectic covering is often a central extension of the form and our extension can be described as that is  the push-forward of central extensions via  There is no difference between genuine and anti-genuine on  The genuine representations  resp  anti-genuine functions  on and are in natural bijection  in view of the push-forward construction above  Working with offers more flexibility  Below is a crucial instance      There exists a canonical element in denoted by the same symbol which satisfies consequently  if we write then This property characterizes as is genuine  It also follows that is of order two  Such a choice is not always possible inside   see  In view of its genuineness  the character will often be used to pin down elements in the fibers of such as in the discussions on splittings  see  Ssec splittings  or in the proof of Proposition prop non-vanishing
Splittings and coverings of metaplectic type

Various splittings
 Let be a general covering as in  Ssec the-central-extension  To do harmonic analysis on one has to specify splittings of the central extension over various subgroups  em Let be a parabolic subgroup of  There is a canonical section of  see or  It is equivariant under -conjugation  Hence we may write and define the parabolic induction functor for coverings  em Specialize now to the metaplectic covering  fix  For a Lagrangian its stabilizer is a parabolic subgroup of   such subgroups are called Siegel parabolics  Thanks to our choice of the Schrödinger model for the Weil representation furnishes a section of  It agrees with on the unipotent radical  Moreover sends to the element of Definition def -1  See  Let be another Lagrangian such that which always exists  Denote the corresponding stabilizer by  Then is a common Levi component of and  It turns out that is independent of the choice of  More generally  the Levi subgroups of arise from data where   i   em is a finite set  em for each is a symplectic -vector space for which are Lagrangians  em is a symplectic -vector space  em we require that as symplectic -vector spaces  orthogonal direct sum   The Levi subgroup is then given by  We will often forget the Lagrangians and write whenever is a given set of indexes and The conjugacy classes of Levi subgroups of are in bijection with equivalence classes of data subject to the conditions above  Now comes the covering  There exists a canonical isomorphism making the following diagram commutes see  These sections are all characterized using the character of the Weil representation  em Since we will invoke global arguments  the unramified setting is also needed  Assume is non-archimedean of residual characteristic but and that admits an -model with   good reduction    we refer to for precise definitions  Set a lattice in then is a hyperspecial subgroup of -- it is exactly the group of -points of with respect to the relevant integral model  Moreover  the lattice model for the Weil representation furnishes a section of  We record the following useful fact  The element equals the in Definition def -1  This results either from or from the comparison between the character formulas and under the hypothesis  In general  let be a reductive -group  Then possesses hyperspecial subgroups if and only if is quasisplit and splits over a unramified extension of  i e   is unramified   in this case  the hyperspecial subgroups are conjugate under  Thus it makes sense to define the unramified Haar measure on by requiring that any hyperspecial subgroup has mass  We shall use unramified measures in Theorem prop FL  In all cases  it is safe to omit the symbols  Unless otherwise specified  the subgroups will thus regarded as subgroups of   the inverse image of a Levi subgroup of will be identified with
Coverings of metaplectic type
 We need a very mild generalization of Weil s metaplectic coverings  Such a class of coverings should contain all and is stable under passage to Levi subgroups   covering metaplectic type   cf       Coverings of the form are called the coverings of metaplectic type  Modulo the knowledge of the harmonic analysis on coverings of metaplectic type reduces immediately to that of  We record a crucial property for Weil s metaplectic coverings  Let be a covering of metaplectic type  Two elements commute if and only if there images commute  As said before  it suffices to prove this for  This is well-known  see eg   for the non-archimedean case 
The global case
 Assume that is a number field  Fix a non-trivial additive character  Let be a symplectic -vector space equipped with an -model  Denote by the locally compact group of -points of where  One may still define Weil s metaplectic covering in the adélic setup  it is an eightfold central extension of locally compact groups  Moreover    i   em one may identify with the quotient where em is the restricted product of the local metaplectic groups with respect to the hyperspecial subgroups alluded to above  for almost all and em we take 	 em still carries the Weil representation which is identified with the tensor product of its local avatars  em there exists a unique section of by which we regard as a discrete subgroup of of finite covolume  See or for a detailed construction using the Stone-von Neumann theorem  The upshot is that   i   em one can develop the theory of automorphic forms and automorphic representations on the covering em and it satisfies all the requirements for the invariant trace formula à la Arthur  see

Spaces of orbital integrals

The spaces
 Let be a connected reductive -group  The Haar measures are prescribed in a coherent manner as in  Ssec orbital-integrals  For and we have defined the normalized orbital integral  Define the -vector space of orbital integrals on as It is endowed with the linear surjection given by  The elements therein are characterized in terms of   i   em local expansion in Shalika germs around each semisimple element  when is non-archimedean Vi81   em Harish-Chandra s jump relations  when is archimedean Bo94b  Note that is topologized in the archimedean case  It is actually a strict inductive limit of Fréchet spaces  also known as LF spaces   see  The map is then an open surjection by the remarks in  We also have a natural isomorphism parallel to The non-archimedean case is quite trivial  whereas in the archimedean case denotes the topological tensor product and the isomorphism is in the category of LF spaces  Any satisfactory description of would require the notion of nuclear spaces introduced by Grothendieck  The space is indeed nuclear since it is a quotient of which is nuclear  cf  the Corollary to  Regarding the isomorphism between and we refer to the arguments in  The references Vi81 Bo94b actually included the case of coverings as well  In particular  we may define the spaces of anti-genuine orbital integrals for a covering  It is regarded as a space of anti-genuine functions equipped with the surjection and an appropriate topology in the archimedean case      When is quasisplit  we may also define the space of stable orbital integrals  together with the linear surjection     C  infty c G F   	  longrightarrow S orbI G 
 f 	  longmapsto   in brief  the diagram commutes  In the archimedean case  the characterization and topology of are discussed in  Elements in the dual spaces  resp   are called invariant distributions  resp  invariant genuine distributions stable distributions  on or  In each case  an element in or is determined by its restriction to any open dense subset of or by the continuity of orbital integrals  All these constructions readily generalize to Lie algebras  the relevant definitions will be recalled in  Ssec image-transfer-cusp

 The geometric transfers to various can now be woven into a   collective   transfer  We shall follow Ar96 closely  Set where  by a standard abuse of notations  we use to denote an endoscopic datum  An element in will be written in the form where or simply as according to the context  The same construction applies to any covering of metaplectic type and its elliptic endoscopic data  the factors will not interfere  Next  note that has a well-defined action on for each namely by permuting the indexing set of its -components  Thus it makes sense to define Equip each with the quotient measure  and equip with the measure of disjoint union  Elements in are written as where or more succinctly as whenever appropriate  In Ar96 there are two ways to define the set for reductive groups  say by looking at either   i   em elliptic endoscopic data of Levi  or em Levi of elliptic endoscopic data  We have seen in Lemma prop z s  that some subtleties arise in the metaplectic case  In this article we follow the previous viewpoint  as in          Define a subspace of  always abusing notations     as follows  Its elements are of the form such that em for every with the function in Definition def s-descent is independent of   em denote the function above by we require that where acts by permuting the indexing set  Also  define the cuspidal subspace  Icusp  EndoE ld eG      oplus  G  Endo  in  EndoE  ell  lde G    S orbI  cusp  G  Endo   quad  subset  orbI  EndoE ld eG    The definition of is best explained by the proof of the following result      The transfer maps assemble into the   collective transfer    mathca lT   EndoE    Iasp ld eG   	  longrightarrow  orbI  EndoE ld eG

Non-standard endoscopy on Lie algebras
 The non-standard endoscopy for Lie algebras is developed in  We give a sketch here  A non-standard endoscopic datum is a triple where are quasisplit simply connected semisimple groups  choose a Borel pair for    the crucial datum is an isomorphism of -vector spaces  such that there exist bijections  chec k au    Sigma G 1  T 1   vee   bar F   	 o  Sigma G 2  T 2   vee   bar F

Statement of the character relations
 Retain the previous notations and assume to be non-archimedean  The main result of this section may be stated in an abstract form as follows  Define the isomorphism as the direct sum over of the cuspidal transfer maps  see Theorem prop transfer-cusp-surj  Then the diagram commutes  The vertical isomorphisms interpret a test function as an element in the relevant Paley-Wiener space  i e   as a function of spectral parameters  Thus the commutative diagram may be seen as an identification between the geometric and spectral transfers  For we define     as a function on  Here we pick an arbitrary representative in for each  Take  We contend that Theorem prop character-relation is equivalent to the assertion that for all and where is as in Definition def f EndoE  In view of Remark rem f EndoE this is exactly except for the twist by which is a metaplectic feature  Let us show the equivalence  In the commutative diagram of Theorem prop character-relation going in the direction  scale 0 5  raw ->   0 0 7  --  0 0  --  1 0   maps first to the function on  say via   then to the function on  We arrive at  On the other hand  by Lemma prop IEndo-grading and the notations therein  going in the direction  scale 0 5  raw ->   0 0 7  --  1 0 7  --  1 0   maps to the function on that sends to which is exactly  This concludes the equivalence since every arises from some  The proof of Theorem prop character-relation or its equivalent form  eqre feqn character-relation-equiv  will occupy  Ssec proof  The upshot will be proving  eqre feqn character-relation-equiv  for elliptic and non-cuspidal  We record several consequences thereof  The collective transfer map is an isomorphism  We will also need the space defined as follows  Its elements are functions on of the form where and ranges over the classes stably conjugate to  see Definition def stable-conj  Thus we have a surjection      For archimedean the space can be made into a nuclear LF space  see

The case
 In what follows we assume  Recall that we have chosen a Borel pair for in  Ssec endoscopy  For every set to be the image of under where  eqre feqn X-vs-Lie  is used  The same notation pertains to  The notations are tailored so that sends to  Since is the maximal compact subgroup of we may identify with by Weyl s unitarian trick  The same holds for as well  Once the Borel subgroups are chosen  one defines the half sums of positive roots respectively  and transport them to via the recipe above  The discussion in  Ssec L-parameters for the discrete series and their limits also applies to  For appropriately chosen Borel pairs and we have   i   em   em   em the Weil representation admits an infinitesimal character  whose representative in can be taken to be   em an irreducible discrete series representation or their limits of with infinitesimal character is genuine only if it factors through only if   the direction   if   holds when one works with the twofold covering  The first two assertions are standard calculations in  The infinitesimal character of is recorded in hence the third assertion  The final assertion follows since is connected as a Lie group  Let and be as in Lemma prop calculation-rho  Following Adams  we define the -packet of genuine discrete series of with infinitesimal character modulo as  Pi   lde G    mbda       pi w ve c mbda     w  in W G  T   backslash W G  C  T  C     Here the Harish-Chandra parameter     is defined by choosing the for which is dominant  Similarly  by allowing certain singularities of the -packet of genuine limits of discrete series of is defined by the same recipe  The stable character attached to those is     S Theta   lde G    mbda     sum   pi  in  Pi   lde G    mbda   Theta   lde G    pi  The counterparts and for the endoscopic side have been reviewed in  Ssec L-parameters and  Ssec stable-character-SO   Adams      If then the map sends to  In particular   The convention in Ad98  Re99 is slightly different  Adams multiplied  resp   by  resp   Here  for every semisimple -group admitting an anisotropic maximal torus  we set where is any maximal compact subgroup  This is harmless since At present we do not need to consider all the inner forms of at once as in

 Consider an arbitrary elliptic endoscopic datum and introduce the groups etc  We have em a chosen maximal compact subgroup of em a chosen Borel pair of em the half-sum of positive roots  em an anisotropic maximal torus of contained in  Let be the isomorphic image of which is a maximal torus of   we may also assume  To save notations we shall identify and  In view of Lemma prop Wst-identification we get the corresponding endoscopic character Introduce an anisotropic maximal torus etc   so that there is some standard isomorphism furnished by Lemma prop diagram  Recall that induces a map between infinitesimal characters of and   infinitesimal character  -regular  Let be the infinitesimal character of a discrete series representation of  i e   is regular   We say is -regular if for some regular infinitesimal character of  For as above  lifts to a genuine character of   note that is not connected  so is actually exponentiated to the twofold connected covering  then extended to by genuineness  Same for  Consider with infinitesimal character  We may choose a Harish-Chandra parameter for  the Borel subgroup datum omitted  of the form such that the orbits of and under and correspond to the two components of respectively  This is done by modifying a given parameter for by using and such a choice is unique  In this manner we deduce from the genuine representation of with Harish-Chandra parameter which we shall denote by  Its central character is denoted by      which can be evaluated at  Note that the same construction generalizes to the case where is a limit of genuine discrete series   Renard Re99   Let be a -regular infinitesimal character of a discrete series representation of and assume  Then where is as in  eqre feqn y   Furthermore  for any and  Let denote the system of -positive roots for  One defines similarly  Choose a Harish-Chandra parameter as in  eqre feqn choice-HC-diamond  so that  In Renard proved that equals Here we can let range over cf  the proof of Lemma prop Wst-identification  By Theorem prop Adams-lifting plus the commutative diagram  eqre feqn spectral-trans-R   the assertion on amounts to the equality between the above sum and  Since and Hence  On the other hand  the character restricts to on  see  Ssec L-parameters  Thus the terms indexed by match  To deal with the other terms  observe that equals the restriction of to thus for all  Note that when the factor generalizes Waldspurger s central signs in the case
Spectral transfer in general
 We will reformulate and generalize the prior results in the language of  Ssec statement  To begin with  fix and let be the -parameter for the discrete series -packet of with infinitesimal character   we do not assume to be -regular  Note that may be put in the normal form where are strictly decreasing sequences of positive half-integers  Cf   Lemma prop calculation-rho  Any infinitesimal character of a genuine limit of discrete series has a similar normal form with   just take the -dominant representative  Each equality sign in this list entails a singularity  Those obtained from by the recipe above  for various are characterized by Indeed  is obtained by merging two lists of half-integers  no in the merged list can occur more then twice  We shall show in Remark rem nondegenerate that is the infinitesimal character of some limit of discrete series      Denote by the subset of consisting of limits of discrete series whose infinitesimal characters satisfy  eqre feqn nondegenerate-lambda   Since is defined in terms of infinitesimal characters  it is a union of -packets of genuine limits of discrete series  For the recipe in Theorem prop Li-lifting-real-reg is still applicable  and we define the sign factor as before  The following result is stated in  Fix and as above  For set if has infinitesimal character otherwise set  We have for any with  Furthermore  for any   Sketch of proof  For -regular this is just Theorem prop Li-lifting-real-reg  To extend it to the present case  we resort to coherent continuation as in Sh82 Sh10   fix a representative of  resp   dominant in some Weyl chamber  resp    then take deep enough in so that is -regular  say  The idea is to apply the translation functor to both sides of the assertion with -regular input with  Recall that produces limits from the genuine discrete series   similarly for the side and for the Weyl translates  By the diagram  eqre feqn spectral-trans-R   the spectral transfer breaks into three stages    i   em Adams  transfer commutes with translation functors by  Recall that the coefficients appearing in are all  em Renard s transfer also commutes with translation functors  this is briefly mentioned in which refers to cf    Loosely speaking  it means that a character relation for still holds after shifting to with the same coefficients  em The operation does not commute with   we get an extra factor  Accordingly  the coefficients in are obtained from by shifting from to as required  cf  the proof of Theorem prop Li-lifting-real-reg  The assertion on can be proved in the same manner as in Theorem prop Li-lifting-real-reg  Generalization to coverings of metaplectic types is straightforward  Now we introduce the collective geometric transfer and regard as a function by the recipe of Lemma prop IEndo-grading  Let say coming from where and sit in a diagram  eqre feqn endo-incomplete   Pick any and  By Theorems prop Li-lifting-real prop transfer-parabolic and the very definition of we get for any where denotes the spectral transfer factor for  Note that only if for each the -components of and match by local Langlands correspondence  From this we deduce the general statement of spectral transfer as follows      There exists a function such that  resp   is of finite support for any given  resp    and is characterized by for all  Suppose that comes from and is arbitrary  then In the formula for the sum is actually taken over a packet determined by  We contend that with equality for at most one  Indeed  as in the reductive case turns out to be the set of irreducible constituents in the normalized parabolic induction of some genuine discrete series -packet for some  By Langlands  disjointness theorem and the theory minimal -types which works for coverings of metaplectic type by the parabolic induction to of is multiplicity-free  Our claim follows immediately    -finite transfer  cf        Let  resp   be a maximal compact subgroup of  resp  of  For any which is -finite under bilateral translation  its transfer can be taken to be -finite as well  The elements of arising from -finite functions have a characterization à la Paley-Wiener  see or  Upon some contemplation on Definition def f EndoE it suffices to show that the function is supported on finitely many connected components of  As remarked in the -finite trace Paley-Wiener theorem of CD84 holds for  Also  by there are only finitely many genuine limits of discrete series of containing a given -type  The required finiteness condition follows readily from the Theorems prop Li-lifting-real and prop character-relation-R

 The local-global loop is now to be closed  We revert to the given local covering attached to and try to embed it into an adélic one  by suitably choosing etc  We will globalize the data of linear algebra by which and are defined  the additive character will be globalized only up to  Let be an elliptic maximal -torus of  For every there exist em a number field em a non-trivial additive character em a symplectic -vector space em   distinct non-archimedean places of em a maximal -torus of such that the following properties are satisfied for the adélic metaplectic covering attached to  em For we have under which   fix such identifications  em The natural homomorphism  see  is an isomorphism at  em There exists such that em As coverings  is isomorphic to  Moreover  the geometric transfer factors on and agree under this isomorphism  em Under the identifications above  the localization of at each is conjugate to   in particular  is -elliptic  em The localization map at any has dense image  The parametrization of conjugacy classes of can be deduced from that of regular semisimple elements  They are in bijection with equivalence classes of data where em is a finite-dimensional étale -algebra  em is an -involution  whose fixed subalgebra we denote by em satisfies equivalently  Here and there is an evident notion of equivalence between these triples  The condition is that the -vector space together with the bilinear form is isomorphic to as symplectic -vector spaces  The torus so obtained is isomorphic to  Call or split if where on each factor   split triples correspond to split maximal -tori  The same parametrization works for any field of characteristic   the base change relative to any field extension is straightforward --- simply apply to étale -algebras with involution  We proceed to globalize  The data parametrizing can be described via Galois descent  say by comparison with the split one  We shall treat the pair first  Let be a Galois extension splitting  Take a number field with a place such that there is an isomorphism which we fix  Therefore acts on   denote its fixed field by  Then  Let be the place of such that then restricts to  In fact  is the unique place of above  Fix an algebraic closure of and pick a Galois extension therein  of degree over which splits completely  Therefore we obtain distinct places with for all  Consider For each take place in such that  By the foregoing discussion  it satisfies the identification  Ga l mathring E   w i   mathrin gF   u i      Ga l mathring E    w    mathrin gF   u       Ga lE F   and is a field  Plugging these into the machine of Galois descent  we produce a global pair over that splits over and localizes to at each  Let us globalize the remaining piece  We claim that the simultaneous localization map is surjective  where  resp   denotes the relevant norm  resp  trace  map  Since is open in it suffices to show the density of in  Indeed  weak approximation holds for the rational variety defined by for any finite set of places   here we take  Therefore can also be globalized to  Consequently we get which localizes to at each together with the maximal torus of parametrized by that localizes to modulo conjugacy  Moreover  splits over  The proof of is based on  eqre feqn Gal-identification   One can either   a   em invoke Tate-Nakayama duality as in to describe these or em use the explicit description of these groups in together with the Galois descent construction  Next  let us globalize  Fix  For each there exists such that  Since is open  weak approximation for the rational -variety  take  yields and such that The additive character satisfies our requirements  From the description of metaplectic coverings in terms of Maslov cocycle the covering is determined by   indeed  this just reflects the properties of Weil index  Hence the requirements on the localization of coverings are also satisfied  The coincidence of transfer factors follows by the same reason  see the formulas in  It remains to show that the localization map say at the place has dense image  To this end  we apply the weak approximation in to with and noting that is a field  Fix the local data and their globalization obtained thus far  with  Set  The next step is to apply simple trace formula with em a large finite set of places  em the distinguished place em a suitable test function under the formalism of  Ssec proof-preparation   here  In what follows  we fix and denote by its localization at  Recall that the data carry an -model for large enough  Given  We may choose a sufficiently large finite set of places and choose satisfying   i   em has regular reduction outside relative to the -model which is a part of our adélic covering   em for every is sufficiently close to an anti-genuine Dirac measure concentrated at the image of in   em for we assume in addition that such that f u V h  in  mathca lH    mathrm simp adm   ld eG  V
