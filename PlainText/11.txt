Introduction
 This memoir is a sequel of the article Bar1 in which we proved that the classical bar complex can be equipped with the structure of an -algebra if is an algebra  To be precise we consider operads in the category of differential graded modules  dg-modules for short  and an -operad refers to a dg-operad equivalent to the operad of associative and commutative algebras  An -algebra refers to an algebra over any given -operad  Similarly one considers -operads  defined as dg-operads equivalent to the operad of associative algebras and -algebras  defined as algebras over an -operad  For our purpose we fix a specific model of an -operad  Namely we consider the classical chain operad of Stasheff s associahedra  The classical notion of an -algebra  defined by a collection of higher associative products is equivalent to the structure of an algebra over this operad  Recall that the bar complex is defined precisely for algebras equipped with such operations  For any -operad there exists a homotopically unique morphism  Once we fix such a morphism any -algebra is provided with the structure of a -algebra and hence has an associated bar complex  In Bar1 we consider only the chain structure of the bar complex  But  classically  one identifies with the tensor coalgebra generated by the suspension of the augmentation ideal of  One observes in addition that the bar differential is defined by a coalgebra coderivation so that the bar complex forms a dg-coalgebra  Therefore a natural aim consists in extending the constructions of Bar1 in the framework of dg-coalgebras  For this purpose we consider operads in the ground symmetric monoidal category of dg-coalgebras  usually called Hopf operads  and algebras over operads in this category  The algebras over a Hopf operad in the category of dg-coalgebras are usually referred to as Hopf -algebras  In fact  one can incidentally forget coalgebra structures and consider algebras over Hopf operads in the underlying category of dg-modules and similarly for other structures  Therefore  as a general rule  the objects defined in the category of dg-coalgebras are referred to by the qualifier Hopf  Otherwise we consider tacitely an underlying structure in the category of dg-modules  For a commutative algebra the classical shuffle product of tensors defines a morphism of differential graded coalgebras  Consequently  the bar complex of a commutative algebra is equipped with the structure of a commutative Hopf algebra  The goal of this memoir is precisely to extend this structure result to -algebras 
Sketch of the memoir results
 Recall briefly that a Hopf operad is defined by a collection of dg-coalgebras acted on by the symmetric group equipped with operad composition products which are morphisms in the category of coalgebras  Similarly  a Hopf -algebra consists of a dg-coalgebra equipped with evaluation products which are morphisms in the category of coalgebras  we refer to subsection HopfOperadsIntroduction for detailed recalls   Observe that the bar coalgebra is equipped with a natural unit morphism  Therefore  for the purposes of this memoir  it is natural to consider unital Hopf operads  equipped with a distinguished unital operation and operad actions for which the unital operation agrees with the natural unit of the bar complex  This unit requirement gives the analogue of a boundary condition for the construction of operad actions on  Indeed  if we restrict ourself to non-negatively graded Hopf operads  then the unit requirement implies the assumption of the uniqueness theorem of Bar1  As in Bar1 we consider also connected operads which  in the unital context  satisfy and  To recapitulate  we suppose given an -operad in the category of dg-modules  equipped with a fixed operad morphism where denotes Stasheff s chain operad  and we consider the bar coalgebra for an algebra over  Then let denote a unital non-negatively graded Hopf -operad  Our main goal is to prove the following theorem    2mm  em The bar complex of an -algebra can be equipped with the structure of a Hopf -algebra functorially in and so that the unital operation agrees with the natural unit of the bar complex provided that is a Reedy cofibrant object in the category of unital Hopf -operads  em Any such -algebra structure where is connected and non-negatively graded satisfies the requirement of the uniqueness theorem of Bar1  More explicitly  if the unit condition of claim  a  is satisfied and the operad is connected and non-negatively graded  then  for a commutative algebra the -algebra structure of reduces automatically to the classical commutative algebra structure of the one given by the shuffle product of tensors  The proof of the existence claim  a  follows the same lines of argument as in the framework of dg-modules  Namely we introduce first a universal unital Hopf operad  the Hopf endomorphism operad of the bar construction which operates functorially on the bar complex of algebras over a given operad  More precisely  we prove the following result  Let denote an operad  in dg-modules  equipped with an operad morphism where denotes Stasheff s chain operad  There is a universal unital Hopf operad such that the bar complex of a -algebra is equipped with the structure of a Hopf algebra over functorially in  More precisely  the Hopf operad operates on the coalgebra functorially in and so that the unital operation agrees with the unit of  Furthermore  we have a one-to-one correspondence between such Hopf operad actions and morphisms of unital Hopf operads  For the sake of completeness  we should point out that the map defines a functor on the category of operads under  As in the context of dg-modules  any coalgebra has an associated endomorphism Hopf operad defined by  HopfEnd   Gamma  r     HopfHom  Gamma   otimes r   Gamma  where denotes an appropriate internal hom-object in the category of coalgebras  By definition a Hopf -algebra structure is equivalent to a Hopf operad morphism  One can adapt this construction for unital coalgebras so that forms a unital Hopf operad and a morphism preserves the distinguished unital operations if and only if in the equivalent Hopf -algebra structure the unital operation agrees with the unit of  The Hopf endomorphism operad of the bar construction is defined by the coend of the bifunctors  HopfEnd  B A   r     HopfHom B A    otimes r  B A   where ranges over the category of -algebras  The assertions of theorem thm BarHopfEndomorphismOperad are immediate from this construction  Notice that this endomorphism operad is -graded and non-connected  like any endomorphism object  The classical commutative algebra structure of the bar complex gives a morphism and the existence assertion of theorem thm HopfExistenceUniqueness is equivalent to the lifting problem   xymatri x 	 	  HopfEnd B   E  ar d

  C ar r   0 33   nabla c  	  HopfOp B   C     commute  As a consequence  for a given -operad any morphism of unital Hopf operads such that is connected and non-negatively graded defines a lifting of
Toward effective constructions
 The lifting process can be made effective for certain operads  Indeed we observed in BarEinfinityNote that the bar complex of an algebra over the so-called surjection operad forms a Hopf algebra over the Barratt-Eccles operad  This structure result gives an explicit instance of a morphism  Recall that the surjection operad is an instance an -operad in the category of dg-modules and the Barratt-Eccles operad is an instance of a Hopf -operad  We are particularly interested in these operads as  on one hand  we proved in BergerFresse  see also McClureSmith  that the surjection operad  as well as the Barratt-Eccles operad  operates on the cochain complex of simplicial sets and  on the other hand  we observed in Bar1 that the bar complex is equivalent as an algebra to the cochain complex of the loop space of  Nevertheless the Barratt-Eccles operad is not cofibrant and theorem thm HopfExistenceUniqueness does not apply to this operad  One could check that the bar complex of an algebra over the Barratt-Eccles operad is not acted on by the Barratt-Eccles operad itself  Therefore we consider the so-called Boardman-Vogt  construction which provides an explicit cofibrant replacement of the Barratt-Eccles operad and for which theorem thm HopfExistenceUniqueness applies  Indeed for the Barratt-Eccles operad a lifting can be constructed by an explicit induction process so that we can obtain effectively a Hopf -algebra structure on the bar complex of algebras over the Barratt-Eccles operad  This morphism seems to factorize through a simplicial decomposition  in fact the chain operad associated to the simplicial Boardman-Vogt construction of the simplicial Barratt-Eccles operad  of the Boardman-Vogt dg-operad  To be more precise  we seem to have closed formulas for a morphism that fits a commutative diagram  xymatri x W   Delta  ar r   0 35   nabla  elta  	  HopfOp B   W   Delta   ar d

Further prospects
 The functorial constructions addressed in this memoir and in the previous article have the drawback to yield only global formulas  valid for all algebras in a category  But one would like to control the structure of the bar construction for algebra subclasses or for a particular subclass of operations  Our idea to address this issue is to introduce cellular operads obtained by a limit-colimit decomposition of an -operads  To motivate this idea  observe that a quotient of an operad is associated to a subcategory of the category of -algebras  a suboperad is associated to a larger category of algebras as the -algebras support less operations  To generalize this process  we shall consider functor operads  in the sense of McClureSmithCosimplicial  on an operad in the category of categories  In the text  we give a few indications on how our constructions might be extended to this context  The crux is to provide the operad of universal bar operations with appropriate cellular structures  As such  the cell categories that one would like to consider have to be motivated by the internal structure of the operad of universal bar operation itself  A good example includes the -cellular operads of Berger BergerEnglish that give rise to sequences of -operads

The operadic framework

On unital and Hopf operads

Introduction and general conventions
 In general the objects that we consider belong to the category of dg-modules over a ground ring  glossar y    always assumed to be a field  and fixed once and for all  We adopt the conventions of Bar1 except that in this memoir we may find more convenient to deal with augmented unitary algebras instead of non-unitary algebras  To be precise  as we equip the bar construction with a Hopf algebra structure  we find better to assume so that the functor targets to a category of augmented unitary objects  On the other hand  the complex is more naturally defined for a non-unitary algebra  Therefore we shall assume on the contrary that the source of the functor lives in a category of non-unitary objects  Anyway  as stated in the memoir introduction  we shall consider unital operads  operad unital   unital operad  which come equipped with a distinguished unital operation  unital operation  that generates so that  for an operad in a module category  the usual case for the operads considered in this memoir   As explained in this assumption implies that the ground field defines the initial object in the category of -algebras  In this context an augmented -algebra refers simply to an algebra equipped with a fixed -algebra morphism  The kernel of this augmentation morphism defines the augmentation ideal of denoted by  Recall that is an algebra over the reduced operad  glossar y    unital operad reduced operad of a  such that if and otherwise  Furthermore  the map defines an equivalence of categories from the category of augmented -algebras to the category of -algebras  On the other hand  we consider always unitary operads  operad unitary   unitary operad   equipped with a unit operation  operad unit operation of an   unit operation of an operad   In the literature  the unital and unitary terminologies are used interchangeably  The reader should not be confused  in this memoir  we use always these terminologies in the sense specified in this introduction  As in Bar1 we may consider connected operads for which the module is spanned by  operad connected   In general the connectedness assumption is not necessary but it can simplify certain constructions  Naturally  a morphism of unital operads is assumed to preserve the unital operation  Accordingly  there is an initial object in the category of unital operads defined explicitly by for and otherwise  The category of augmented algebras over this initial operad is equivalent to the category of dg-modules since any augmented algebra over has the form for a dg-module  Observe that the category of unital operads is also endowed with a terminal object given by the commutative operad  see item UnitaryOperadAdjunction  The aim of this section is to fix our conventions in regard to unital and Hopf operads and to prove the fundamental properties of the categories formed by these objects  More specifically  as explained in the memoir introduction  we introduce a new model structure for unital operads which gives an appropriate framework for the constructions of Hopf operad actions on the bar complex  Recall briefly that our model category structure is deduced from a generalization of the classical Reedy constructions and differs from the model structure defined in BergerMoerdijk like classical Reedy model structures differ from adjoint model structures  Here is the plan of this section  For our purposes we need more insights into the structure of the underlying -module of a unital-operad and we devote the next subsection subsection LambdaModulesIntroduction to this topic  Then we perform the construction of the Reedy model structure of unital operads in two steps  first  in subsection ModelCategoryLambdaModules we define a model structure at the -module level  then in subsection UnitalOperadsReedyModelStructure we transfer this structure to unital operads by the classical adjunction process  In the last subsection subsection HopfOperadsIntroduction we generalize these constructions to unital Hopf operads after recalls and precisions on this notion 
On -modules and unital operads
 Classically  one observes that the operadic composites with a unital operation  glossar y    defined for if provide the underlying -module of a unital operad with morphisms such that for  The structure of a preoperad introduced in Berger consists precisely of a -module equipped with such morphisms  As explained in loc  cit  one can observe that the structure of a preoperad is equivalent to a contravariant functor where  glossar y   denotes the category formed by the finite sets and the injective maps  In this memoir we prefer to adopt the terminology of a -module   -module  for this structure which is more consistent with our terminology of a -module   -module  for a collection of -modules  Similarly  the set of morphisms in is denoted by  glossar y   so that  In this memoir  we consider tacitely only right -modules  that are contravariant functors on the category in contrast to left -modules that are covariant functors  Accordingly  the -action on a -module restricts naturally to a right action of the symmetric groups  On the other hand  we assume by convention that a -module is acted on by permutations on the left  but left and right actions are equivalent for group actions and this convention difference does not create any actual difficulty  In this subsection we make explicit the relationship between -modules and -modules and between non-unital operads and unital operads  To be precise  we consider the following categories  em the category  glossar y   formed by the non-unital -modules   -module non-unital   non-unital  -module  -- the -modules such that   the category  glossar y   formed by the unitary objects of   -module unitary   unitary  -module  -- a unitary object in consists of a -module equipped with a unit element   and the category  glossar y   formed by unitary objects equipped with an augmentation over the underlying -module of the reduced commutative operad  glossar y    em the category  glossar y   formed by the non-unital -modules   -module non-unital   non-unital  -module  -- the -modules such that   the category  glossar y   formed by the unitary objects of   -module unitary   unitary  -module  -- a unitary object in consists of a -module equipped with a unit element   and the category  glossar y   formed by unitary objects equipped with an augmentation  glossar y    em the category  glossar y   formed by the non-unital unitary operads  operad non-unital   non-unital operad  -- the unitary operads such that   and the category  glossar y   formed by the operads equipped with an augmentation over the reduced commutative operad  glossar y    em the category  glossar y   formed by the unital unitary operads -- the unitary operads such that for a distinguished operation  Observe that the unit of a -module   -module unit element of a   unit element of a -module  is equivalent to a -module morphism where denotes the non-unital -module such that and for  Accordingly  the category of augmented unitary -modules is defined by a comma category and similarly for the category of augmented unitary -modules  The connections between these categories can be summarized by a diagram of categorical adjunctions  xymatri x  Sigma   Mod 1 0  overline  C  ar <1mm> r   0 55   FOp  ar <2mm> d  ar <-2mm> d  	  Op 1 0  overlin e C  ar <1mm> l  ar <2mm> d  ar <-2mm> d

 respectively  quad DGHom   R     SOp   M  y     int  x in R    M x    SOp  y    phi x     where the notation respectively refers to the classical tensor product  respectively mapping object  of a dg-module with a set   As explained in Bar1 our conventions for ends and coends are converse to the usual one  we use superscripts for ends and subscripts for coends   To begin our constructions we study the connection between the category of unital and non-unital operads 
Unitary operads versus non-unital operads
 In fact  if we reverse the definition of the reduced operad  glossar y    then  for a unital operad we obtain the relation  P r     F 	 if
  overlin e P  r  	 otherwise  Furthermore  the operad composition products are determined for by the composition products of the reduced operads  As a consequence  the structure of is completely determined by the associated reduced operad and by morphisms that keep track on the composite with the unital operation at the level of the reduced operad  Observe in addition that a unital operad comes equipped with augmentation morphisms  glossar y   which map an operation to the composite and such that for all  As a byproduct  these augmentation morphisms give rise to an operad morphism where denotes the operad of commutative algebras  recall that for   so that any unital operad is canonically augmented over the commutative operad  Hence the commutative operad defines the terminal object in the category of unital operad as mentioned in the introduction of this section  Finally  our observations prove that a unital operad is equivalent to a non-unital operad equipped with morphisms for and such that the associativity and commutativity properties of operad composition products are satisfied for the operations and with an augmentation morphism that preserves all operadic composites including the composites with the unital operation  As a byproduct  one can prove that the functor creates small colimits in the category of unital operads  Explicitly  for a diagram of unital operads one observes readily that the colimit is equipped with canonical operations and with an augmentation induced by the corresponding operations of the unital operads  As a consequence  this colimit is associated to a unital operad an this operad defines necessarily the colimit of the operads in the category of unital operads 
The adjunction between -modules and non-unital operads
 As explained in the introduction of this subsection  we consider the obvious forgetful functor from the category of non-unital unitary operads to the category of non-unital unitary -modules which maps an operad to its underlying -module  The left adjoint of this functor is given by a variant of the classical free operad  glossar y    free non-unital operad   operad non-unital free   operad free non-unital  defined in the literature  Namely  in the unitary context  the universal morphism is supposed to map the unit of to the unit of the free operad and hence to define a morphism in the category of unitary -modules  Furthermore  the adjunction relation supposes that an operad morphism is associated to a -module morphism that preserves unit elements  Equivalently  for the universal property  one assumes that the -module morphisms that preserve unit elements have a unique factorization  xymatrix C 4m m M ar rd  f ar rr   phi 	 	  P
 	  FOp M  ar  -->  ru    phi f
   such that is an operad morphism  Accordingly  the free operad associated to a unitary -module has to be defined by a quotient of the classical free operad associated to a non-unitary -module  Explicitly  for a unitary -module we make the internal unit equivalent to the unit of the free operad in  Up to this quotient process we refer to our article OperadTextbook from which we borrow our conventions  for an explicit construction of the free operad that follows closely the original constructions of GetzlerGoerss GinzburgKapranov  The definition of tree structures that occur in this construction is also recalled in subsection CellMetricTrees for the purposes of Boardman-Vogt  -construction  Recall that can be defined simply by the modules spanned by formal expressions which represent composites of generators
On unitary and non-unitary -modules
 In fact  in our context  we could replace unitary -modules by equivalent non-unitary -modules  Explicitly  recall that we consider -module which are augmented over the reduced commutative operad  For such -modules we have a canonical splitting where denotes the cokernel of the morphism defined by the unit element  Indeed  since the morphism has a canonical left-inverse given by the augmentation  Consequently  if we let denote the non-unitary -module such that and for then the map defines an equivalence from the category formed by unitary -modules augmented over the reduced commutative operad  to the category formed by non-unitary -modules which are augmented over the augmentation ideal of the commutative operad  Furthermore  the free operad associated to a unitary -module is clearly isomorphic to the free operad associated to the equivalent non-unitary -module  For our purpose it is more natural to deal with unitary objects and we do not use this relationship  Nevertheless one can conclude immediately from these observations that the free operad functor satisfies the same homological properties as the free operad  For instance  the functor maps weak-equivalences of unitary -modules to weak-equivalences of operads 
The adjunction between -modules and unital operads
 The functor  glossar y    free unital operad   operad unital free   operad free unital  considered in the introduction of this subsection is defined as the left adjoint of the functor from the category of unital operads to the category of augmented non-unital unitary -modules  The operad associated to a given non-unital module can also be characterized by the usual universal property  In fact  the reduced operad associated to can be identified with the usual free operad so that  FOp   M  r     F 	 if

 Sometimes we can find convenient to consider unital unitary -modules  unital  -module    -module unital  -- explicitly  unital -modules such that for a distinguished element such that  Equivalently  a unital -module consists of a -module equipped with a unit morphism where denotes the underlying -module of the initial unital operad  such that is iso  Clearly  the underlying -module of a unital operad is unital  Observe that a unital -module is equipped with a canonical augmentation  glossar y   like a unital operad  Explicitly  the map defined for a unital operad in item UnitaryOperadAdjunction can be identified with the -module operation associated to the initial map  glossar y    If we assume then this operation gives a morphism from to the constant -module that represents the underlying -module of the commutative operad  The definition of the reduced operad can also be extended to unital -modules  Explicitly  for a unital -module we consider the -module such that and for  Clearly  this object forms a non-unital unitary -module  Since any unital -module is augmented over the map defines a functor where denotes the category of unital unitary -modules  The functor has clearly a left adjoint  Explicitly  the unital -module associated to an augmented non-unital -module is defined by and for  The operations are induced by the corresponding operations of and by the augmentation  Clearly  these functors yield inverse adjoint equivalences of categories   xymatri x  -      Lambda   op    Mod 1 0 ar <2pt> r    simeq  	  ar <2pt> l    simeq  Lambda   op    Mod 1     -   -   
Connected unital operads
 As mentioned in the section introduction  we may consider connected unital operads such that the module is spanned by the operad unit  operad connected   operad unitary connected   Let  glossar y   denote the category formed by these objects  The category embedding  glossar y   preserves clearly colimits and limits and hence admits both a right and a left adjoint denoted by  glossar y   and  glossar y   respectively  We give an explicit construction of these functors in the next paragraph  We check in addition that the adjunction unit respectively the adjunction augmentation is an isomorphism for all connected unital operad respectively  Consequently  we have an adjunction ladder   xymatri x  Op     ar r    r 1    	  Op 1   ar <-6mm> l    ctr 1    ar < 6mm> l    str 1      such that  In forthcoming constructions non-connected operads can be replaced by the associated connected object  Therefore we could restrict ourself to connected unital operads  To conclude  the map and the free operad restrict to adjoint functors  FOp    g Lambda   op    Mod   0  overlin e C  leftarrows g Op       -   -   where denotes the category formed by the connected non-unital unitary -modules  the non-unital unitary -modules such that and
The adjunction between connected and non-connected unital objects
 We give an explicit construction of the connected operad respectively associated to a unital operad respectively  In fact  we define an adjunction ladder for the underlying categories of unital unitary -modules   xymatri x  Lambda   op    Mod     ar r    r 1    	  Lambda   op    Mod 1   ar <-6mm> l    ctr 1    ar < 6mm> l    str 1       glossar y   glossar y   glossar y   One can check readily that the connected unital unitary -module associated to a unital operad forms a suboperad of and similarly the -module forms a quotient operad of  Hence  for operads  the map respectively gives rise to a right  respectively left  adjoint of the category embedding  For and we consider the -module operation associated to the map  glossar y   such that  For an operad we have equivalently where unital operations are substituted to the entries of the operation  For let denotes the submodule of defined by the pullback diagram  xymatri x  str 1   N  r  ar  -->  r  ar  -->  d  	 N r  ar d     eta i    i
  F   mes r  ar r   1   mes r   	 N 1    mes r    in which we consider the morphism defined by the unit element  One checks readily that these dg-modules define a -submodule of  Furthermore  any morphism of unitary unital -module such that is connected factorizes through since we have a commutative diagram  xymatri x M r  ar r  f ar d    eta i    	 N r  ar d    eta i  
 M 1     F ar r   1  	 N 1    for all  Therefore the functor satisfies the adjunction relation  According to this construction  we have clearly for any connected unital unitary -module  The other connected -module associated to a unital unitary -module can clearly be defined by for and for  For the operations are given by the augmentation morphism  The relation that holds for a connected -module is also immediate from this definition 
The Reedy model structure for -modules
 The aim of this section is to prove the following theorem  The category of  or -graded  dg- -modules is equipped with the structure of a cofibrantly generated model category such that a morphism is a weak-equivalence  respectively a cofibration  if defines a weak-equivalence  respectively a cofibration  in the category of dg- -modules  In this statement we consider the category formed by all -modules which do not satisfy necessarily  On the other hand  for our purposes we need a model structure on the category of non-unital -modules and on the associated comma category of augmented unitary -modules  In fact  we use the following claim in order to equip with the structure of a model subcategory of   The category embedding admits a left and a right adjoint  xymatri x g Lambda   op    Mod 0 ar r    r   Lambda  0  	 g Lambda   op    Mod ar <-6mm> l    ctr   Lambda  0  ar < 6mm> l    str   Lambda  0    such that  Furthermore  the functor preserves cofibrations and all weak-equivalences in  The proof of this proposition is straightforward  The construction of non-unital -modules respectively is similar to the construction of the connected unital -module respectively given in item ConnectedAdjointOperads  Explicitly  for we set simply for and for  According to this construction  the functor preserves clearly cofibrations  acyclic cofibrations and all week-equivalences in  For we consider the operation associated to the map  Then  for we set explicitly  More categorically  the module can be defined by the pullback diagram  xymatri x  str   Lambda  0 N  r  ar  -->  r  ar  -->  d  	 N r  ar d    eta 0  
 0 ar r   0  	 N 0     Then  assuming theorem thm LambdaModuleModelStructure we obtain  The category of non-unital dg- -modules  linebreak forms a model subcategory of so that a morphism is a weak-equivalence  respectively a cofibration  a fibration  of non-unital dg- -modules if and only if defines a weak-equivalence  respectively a cofibration  a fibration  in  Furthermore  this category is cofibrantly generated by the morphisms associated to a generating set of cofibrations  respectively acyclic cofibrations  in  This assertion is a straightforward consequence of the adjunction relation and the invariance of with respect to cofibrations and weak-equivalences  The category of augmented unitary -modules which is a comma category associated to is equipped with a canonical induced model structure as usual   medskip In fact  theorem thm LambdaModuleModelStructure holds for a category of -objects in any cofibrantly generated model category and not only in the category of dg-modules  Therefore we make our arguments as general as possible though we consider explicitly only dg-modules  and dg-coalgebras in the next section   In a first stage we make explicit the definition of a fibration in the category of -modules  Then we prove that the lifting properties  M4 i-ii  are satisfied  we specify generating collections of cofibrations and acyclic cofibrations and we deduce the factorization properties  M5 i-ii  from the classical small objects argument  The properties  M1-3  are inherited from the ground model category  The general idea of our construction is provided by a generalization of the classical Reedy model structure in the presence of automorphisms  To be precise  in the usual definition of Reedy structures one considers functors on a fixed small category equipped with a grading and a decomposition where the direct Reedy category respectively the inverse Reedy category denote subcategories of formed by collections of morphisms that increase  respectively decrease  the grading  One can observe that classical constructions  given in Reedy s original article Reedy and in the modern monographs Hirschhorn HoveyTextBook still work for a category that contains automorphisms and such that any morphism has a unique decomposition in which and is an automorphism  This extension of Reedy structures does not seem to occur in the literature in full generality though an instance is supplied by the strict model category of -spaces defined in BousfieldFriedlander  Therefore we give detailed arguments for the category  By contravariance  we have in this case for a Reedy direct subcategory of and is trivial  The latter property simplifies some constructions  In the next sections we call the model structure supplied by theorem thm LambdaModuleModelStructure the Reedy model structure  Reedy model category of -modules    -module Reedy model category of -modules  in order to distinguish this model category from the classical adjoint model structure  the cofibrantly generated model category of  from which it differs  To be precise  recall that the classical adjoint model structure is defined by a transfer of model structures from dg-modules to -modules through a composite adjunction  xymatri x g Mod   N  ar <14pt> r    phi    	  ar <0pt> l    phi    g Sigma   Mod  ar <14pt> r    psi    	  ar <0pt> l    psi    g Lambda   op    Mod    Explicitly  one let a morphism defines a weak-equivalence  respectively a fibration  in the adjoint model category if defines a weak-equivalence  respectively a fibration  in  According to this definition  the Reedy model category and the adjoint model category have the same weak-equivalences but different cofibrations and fibrations  In fact  a Reedy fibration defines a fibration in the adjoint model category and hence the Reedy model category has less fibrations but more cofibrations than the adjoint model category  As a byproduct  the identity functor yields a pair of adjoint derived equivalences between the two homotopy categories  Thus the Reedy model structure of -modules is different but Quillen equivalent to the adjoint model structure like a classical Reedy category  see
The category
 glossar y   Recall that a -module is equivalent to a contravariant functor on the category formed by the finite sets and the injective maps  This equivalence is also a consequence of the decomposition of into a direct subcategory and a subcategory of isomorphisms that we make explicit in this paragraph  Namely let denote the subcategory of whose morphisms are the non-decreasing injections  One observes readily that any morphism has a unique -decomposition in which and  Moreover  the category is the category generated by the injections that avoid endowed with the relations for  With respect to permutations we have also a relation of the form which gives the -decomposition of  As a consequence  as stated in the introduction subsection LambdaModulesIntroduction the structure of a -module is indeed equivalent to a -module equipped with operations that satisfy the relations above  Anyway the category forms clearly a direct Reedy category and we have a generalized Reedy decomposition  As explained previously  we adapt the classical construction of Reedy model structures to this context  In the next paragraphs we let respectively denote the comma category of morphisms in respectively such that  Observe that the -decomposition property implies readily that is cofinal in
Matching modules and fibrations of -modules
 In order to obtain an explicit characterization of fibrations we need to introduce a notion of a matching object in the category of -modules   -module matching object of a   matching object of a -module   Explicitly  the matching object of a -module is defined by the collection of dg-modules such that  Matc hM  r     mylim   alpha   underline r   xrightarro w<  underlin er   M r    where the limit ranges over the category or  equivalently  over the category which is cofinal in by the observation of the previous paragraph  As usual the dg-module can equivalently be defined by an equalizer  Matc hM  r     ker l  xymatri x   <2mm>  prod  1 q i q r  M r-1   ar <2pt> r   d 0  ar <-2pt> r   d 1  	   <2mm > prod  1 q i<j q r  M r-2     r   where and  The matching modules are endowed with natural morphisms induced by the morphisms on the component of the limit indexed by  Explicitly  if we represent an element of the limit by a collection where then  for we have  The matching module is also equipped with a canonical -module structure such that defines a morphism of -modules  Explicitly  for any morphism if we let denote an element of then we have an associated element in which can be defined by the collection   We let a morphism of -modules be a fibration if  for all the natural morphism   mu p   M r  arrow Matc hM  r  mes   Match N  r   N r  defines a fibration in the category of dg-modules and hence in the category of -modules for the classical model structure of -modules   Reedy fibration of -modules   fibration Reedy fibration of -modules   medskip As stated previously  the properties  M1-3  of a model category are inherited from the ground category of dg-modules  The first non-trivial verification is supplied by the following claim  The properties  M4 i-ii  hold for the class of weak-equivalences  cofibrations and fibrations specified in theorem thm LambdaModuleModelStructure and paragraph item LambdaModuleFibrations  Explicitly  in a commutative diagram of -modules  xymatri x A ar  >->    D-<0pt 4pt>  d  U  i  ar r   f  	 M ar  ->>  d   p
 B ar r   g  ar  -->  ur   h  	 N    the lift exists provided that is an acyclic fibration  M4 i   respectively provided that is an acyclic cofibration  M4 ii   In both cases we construct by induction over a morphism that commutes with the action of morphisms such that  Explicitly  if the morphisms are defined for then we have a well defined induced morphism so that we obtain a commutative diagram  xymatri x A r  ar  >->    D-<0pt 4pt>  d   0 35  i  ar r  	 M r  ar  ->>  d     mu p 
 B r  ar r  ar  -->  ur   h  	  Matc hM  r  mes   Match N  r   N r    in the category of -modules  The right-hand side morphism is a fibration of -modules by definition and the left-hand side morphism a cofibration  If is an acyclic cofibration  then  by definition  the left-hand side morphism is obviously an acyclic cofibration as well so that the lift exists in this case since the lifting property  M4 ii  is known to be satisfied in the adjoint model category -modules  If is an acyclic cofibration  then we claim that the right-hand side morphism is also an acyclic fibration  In fact  if we forget the symmetric group action  then the dg-modules can be identified with the matching modules of the functor underlying on the direct Reedy category  Therefore we deduce from the classical theory that the morphism defines an acyclic fibration in the category of dg-modules  see for instance  and hence in the category of -modules  Finally  the lift exists in this case as well again since the lifting property  M4 i  is known to be satisfied in the adjoint model category -modules  By construction  our morphism makes the diagram  xymatri x M r  ar r   h  ar d  	 N r  ar d 
  Matc hM  r  ar r  	  Matc hN  r    commute  This property implies immediately that commutes with all morphisms such that and hence with all morphisms since is -equivariant as well by construction  Now we aim to define generating cofibrations and acyclic cofibrations in the category of -modules so that we can deduce  M5 i-ii  from the small object argument  For this purpose we extend the tensor product of dg-modules with simplicial sets to -sets and we consider for the obvious generators of the category of -sets supplied by the classical Yoneda lemma and the associated latching -sets that give representatives for the matching space modules  We define these objects explicitly in the nexts paragraphs 
Generating -sets
 As usual  for any object we have a canonical -set  denoted by defined by the functor corepresented by and such that for  By definition  the map defines a covariant functor from to the category of -sets  Therefore we can form the associated latching object which are defined explicitly by the colimit  Latc h Lambda r     colim   alpha   underline r   xrightarro w<  underlin er    Lambda  r    As usual for a functor  this colimit can be determined pointwise so that is determined by the equivalent colimit in the category of sets   Latc h Lambda r  s     colim   alpha   underline r   xrightarro w<  underlin er    Lambda  s   r   quad for all  As in the definition of a matching module  we can assume that the colimit ranges over the category or  equivalently  over the category which is cofinal in  We have a canonical morphism for  In fact  this morphism is either trivial or an isomorphism  To be precise  we obtain    2mm  em For we have and is an isomorphism  em For we have and so that is an initial morphism in the category of sets  em For we have  The assertions  b-c  are immediate since for and only assertion  a  deserves a verification  In fact  for the map mbda   colim   alpha   underline r   xrightarro w<  underlin er    Lambda  s   r   arrow Lambda  s   r  admits a canonical section that maps an element to the identity morphism in the component of the colimit indexed by  One checks readily that this section gives also a left-inverse for the map so that is an isomorphism 
The tensor product with a -set
 In general the tensor product of an object with a -set is the -module defined by the coproducts C otimes A r    oplus   alpha in A r   C  In the context of dg-modules the tensor product can be also be represented by the tensor product of with the free module spanned by the set  Hence an element of can be represented by a tensor where and  For a morphism in the category of dg-modules  we form the pushout of -modules  xymatri x C otimes Latch  Lambda r  ar r  ar d  	 D otimes Latc h Lambda r  ar d 
 C otimes Lambda r ar r  	 C otimes Lambda r oplus  C otimes Latch  Lambda r   D otimes Latc h Lambda r  pus h4    and we consider the natural morphism C otimes Lambda r oplus  C otimes Latch  Lambda r   D otimes Latc h Lambda r  arrow D otimes Lambda r induced by and  We prove precisely that such morphisms give a set of generating arrows in the category of -modules  The morphisms C otimes Lambda r oplus  C otimes Latch  Lambda r   D otimes Latc h Lambda r  arrow D otimes Lambda r associated to a generating set of cofibrations  respectively acyclic cofibrations  of the category of dg-modules define a generating set of cofibrations  respectively acyclic cofibrations  in the category of -modules  The proof of this lemma is split up into a sequence of claims and can be compared with the classical construction of  First  we observe that the morphisms considered are indeed cofibrations  respectively acyclic cofibrations  in the category of -modules  If is a cofibration  respectively an acyclic cofibration  in the category of dg-modules  then the associated morphism C otimes Lambda r oplus  C otimes Latch  Lambda r   D otimes Latc h Lambda r  arrow D otimes Lambda r is a cofibration  respectively an acyclic cofibration  in the category of -modules  This assertion is a consequence of observation obsv LambdaSetLatching  Explicitly  from this statement one deduces that the morphism C otimes Lambda r s  oplus  C otimes Latch  Lambda r  s   D otimes Latc h Lambda r  s  arrow D otimes Lambda r s  is an isomorphism for can be identified with for and vanishes for  Consequently  this morphism is a cofibration  respectively an acyclic cofibration  of -modules in all cases  this assertion is trivial in the cases and and holds by definition  of cofibrations in the category of -modules  in the case  Then we check that the sets of arrows introduced in the lemma detect acyclic fibrations  respectively fibrations  For this purpose we observe that the tensor products and are characterized by natural adjunction relations  Namely  For a dg-module and a -module we have the adjunction formulas  Hom   g Lambda   op    Mod  C otimes Lambda r M     Hom   g Mod  C M r  
 and  quad Hom   g Lambda   op    Mod  C otimes Latc h Lambda r  M     Hom   g Mod  C  Matc hM  r   and the morphism  Hom   g Lambda   op    Mod  C otimes Lambda r M  xrightarro wC otimes mbda     Hom   g Lambda   op    Mod  C otimes Latc h Lambda r  M  induced by the latching morphism agrees with the morphism induced by the matching morphism  These adjunction claims are formal consequences of the definition of the -sets and of the Yoneda lemma  As a corollary  we obtain  For a morphism of -modules the lifting problem  xymatri x C otimes Lambda r oplus  C otimes Latch  Lambda r   D otimes Latc h Lambda r  ar r  ar d  	 M ar d   p
 D otimes Lambda r ar r  ar  -->  ur  	 N   is equivalent to an adjoint lifting problem  xymatri x C ar r  ar d  	 M r  ar d     mu p 
 D ar r  ar  -->  ur  	  Matc hM  r  otimes   Match N  r   N r    in the category of dg-modules  This observation is a formal consequence of the adjunction relations of observation obsv FreeLambdaModules  This observation implies immediately that the arrows introduced in lemma lemm LambdaModuleGeneratingCofibrations detect acyclic fibrations and fibrations and achieve the proof of that statement   medskip The next claim is a consequence of lemma lemm LambdaModuleGeneratingCofibrations and of the classical small object argument  The properties  M5 i-ii  hold for the class of weak-equivalences  cofibrations and fibrations specified in theorem thm LambdaModuleModelStructure and paragraph item LambdaModuleFibrations  Explicitly  any morphism of -modules admits a factorization such that is a cofibration and an acyclic fibration  M5 i   respectively such that is an acyclic cofibration and a fibration  M5 ii   The arguments are classical  We refer to  This claim achieves the proof of theorem thm LambdaModuleModelStructure
The Reedy model structure for unital operads
 In this section we check that the Reedy model structure of -modules can be transferred to operads through the adjunction  FOp    g Lambda   op    Mod 1 0  overlin eC  leftarrows g Op 1     -   -  defined in item FreeUnitalOperads  Explicitly  we have the following theorem  The category of  or -graded  unital operads is equipped with the structure of a cofibrantly generated model category such that a morphism is a weak-equivalence  respectively a fibration  if forms a Reedy weak-equivalence  respectively a Reedy fibration  in the category of -modules   Reedy model category of unital operads  The cofibrations are characterized by the left lifting property with respect to acyclic fibrations as usual  Our model structure differs from the adjoint model structure defined in BergerMoerdijkW like the Reedy model structure of -modules differs from the adjoint model structure  Nevertheless one can observe again that the identity functor yields a pair of adjoint derived equivalences between the two model categories  Theorem thm UnitalOperadModelStructure follows from the general transfer principle considered in loc  cit  since we observe in lemma lemm LambdaModuleGeneratingCofibrations that the category of -modules is cofibrantly generated and the scheme of the proof of theorem thm UnitalOperadModelStructure is classical  As in BergerMoerdijk we have essentially to check that the following property is satisfied  Suppose given a pushout of unital operads  xymatri x  FOp   C  ar  >->    D-<0pt 4pt>  d   0 35  i   0 35   sim  ar r   f  	  P ar d   j
  FOp   D  ar r   g  	  Q pus h4    such that is a morphism of free operads induced by an acyclic cofibration of -modules  The morphism is a weak-equivalence as well  This property is inherited from the analogous property of non-unital operads  for which we can refer to BergerMoerdijk Hinich since we observe that the functor from the category of unital operads to the category of non-unital operads creates pushouts  According to the transfer principle  see BergerMoerdijk Crans   this verification achieves the proof of theorem thm UnitalOperadModelStructure   medskip Theorem thm UnitalOperadModelStructure holds for the category of connected unital dg-operads  In this case we consider the category introduced in item ConnectedUnitaryOperads formed by the augmented non-unital unitary -modules such that  According to observations of this paragraph  we have an adjunction relation between this category and connected unital operads   FOp    g Lambda   op    Mod   0  overlin e C  leftarrows g Op       -   -   Furthermore  the functor creates also pushouts in so that the argument above remains valid for  On the other hand  one can deduce from the adjunction relations of item ConnectedAdjointOperads that the category of connected unital dg-operads forms a model subcategory of so that a morphism of connected unital dg-operads defines a Reedy cofibration  respectively a Reedy fibration  a weak-equivalence  in if and only if it defines a Reedy cofibration  respectively a Reedy fibration  a weak-equivalence  in  As a byproduct  we have the following statement  The functor right adjoint to the category embedding preserves fibrations  acyclic fibrations and all weak-equivalences between fibrant operads  This claim could also be deduced from an analogous assertion for -modules since operad fibrations  respectively weak-equivalences  are just fibrations  respectively weak-equivalences  in the -module category  To be precise  the statement above is implied by the analogous assertion for the category embedding
On Hopf -modules and unital Hopf operads
 Recall that the notion of an operad makes sense in any symmetric monoidal category  In this memoir  if no category is specified  then an operad refers to an operad in the category of dg-modules since this category forms our ground monoidal category  On the other hand  as explained in the introduction  we consider also Hopf operad structures which are precisely operads in the category of augmented coassociative dg-coalgebras  denoted by  glossar y    The purpose of this section is to make clear the structure of a Hopf operad and to prove the analogue of theorem thm UnitalOperadModelStructure for Hopf operads  Namely we prove that unital Hopf operads form a model category 
On  unital  Hopf operads
 Explicitly  a Hopf operad  Hopf operad   operad Hopf  consists of a collection of coalgebras such that the operad composition products define morphisms in as well as the isomorphisms defined by the action of permutations  As usual for bialgebra structures  one can equivalently assume that the diagonals define an operad morphism  where the tensor product is equipped with place-by-place composition products  The distinguished unital operation and the operad unit are supposed to define group-like elements in  One can observe that the composition products preserve the coalgebra augmentations if and only if these morphisms define a morphism to the operad of commutative algebras  Accordingly  any Hopf operad is automatically augmented over the commutative operad  Furthermore  for a unital Hopf operad we deduce from these observations that the coalgebra augmentations agree with the augmentation morphisms introduced in the introduction of this section and defined by the operadic composites  glossar y    Similarly  a Hopf algebra over  operad Hopf Hopf algebra over a   Hopf algebra over a Hopf operad  refers to an algebra over in the category of augmented coassociative dg-coalgebras  Hence a Hopf algebra consists of a coalgebra equipped with evaluation products that form morphisms in  As stated previously for the composition products of a Hopf operad  one can equivalently assume that the diagonal of defines a morphism of -algebras where the tensor product is equipped with a diagonal action of  If is a unital Hopf operad  Hopf operad unital   unital Hopf operad   operad unital Hopf   then a Hopf -algebra comes equipped with a unit morphism  unit of a coalgebra   coalgebra unit of a  yielded by the unital operation  Consequently  the underlying coalgebra of a Hopf algebra over a unital operad defines an object in the category  glossar y   of augmented unitary coalgebras  unitary coalgebra   coalgebra unitary   By convention  if a given augmented unitary coalgebra is equipped with the structure of a Hopf -algebra  where is a unital Hopf operad  then we assume that the unit of agrees with the unital operation 
Hopf -modules
 Observe that the underlying -module of a unital Hopf operad defines a -object in the category of augmented coassociative dg-coalgebras  This structure is called a Hopf -module  Hopf -module    -module Hopf  according to our usual conventions  Clearly  a Hopf -module is automatically augmented over the constant -module since the coalgebra augmentation gives a morphism as in the case of unital Hopf operads  To recapitulate  the forgetful functor of unital operads considered in item FreeUnitalOperads restricts to a functor from the category of unital Hopf operads to the category of non-unital unitary Hopf -modules  In the converse direction  if a unitary -module is equipped with a coalgebra structure  then the associated free unital operad can be equipped with the structure of a unital Hopf operad so that  glossar y    free unital Hopf operad   Hopf operad free unital  satisfies the usual universal property for Hopf -modules  In fact  since the diagonal of a Hopf operad is supposed to define an operad morphism  the diagonal of a formal composite in can be written  Delta mma     sum   mma 1  ots  mma r   ots  mma  1 circ  i 2  mma  2  circ  i 3  ots  circ  i l  mma  l  otimes  ots  mma   1 circ  i 2  mma   2  circ  i 3  ots  circ  i l  mma   l  where denotes the diagonal of in  To conclude  the forgetful functor from unital Hopf operads to unital operads creates free objects  As a consequence  for unital Hopf operads  we have an adjunction relation  FOp    g Lambda     op  HopfMod 1 0 leftarrows g HopfOp 1     -   -    glossar y   glossar y   where denotes the free operad functor defined in subsection LambdaModulesIntroduction  One can observe in addition that the forgetful functor creates also all small colimits in the category of unital Hopf operads since the forgetful functor from the category of coalgebras to the category of dg-modules has this property 
The model category of coalgebras
 According to GetzlerJones the category of non-negatively graded dg-coalgebras over a field is equipped with the structure of a model category such that a morphism is a weak-equivalence  respectively a cofibration  if defines a weak-equivalence  respectively a cofibration  in the category of dg-modules   Recall that a morphism of dg-modules over a field is a cofibration if and only if it is injective   Furthermore  this category has a set of generating cofibrations  respectively acyclic cofibrations  defined by the collection of injective morphisms such that is spanned by a finite  respectively countable  set of homogeneous elements  As specified in subsection ModelCategoryLambdaModules the Reedy model structure of theorem thm LambdaModuleModelStructure can be defined in any cofibrantly generated ground model category  In particular  for the -objects in the category of dg-coalgebras we obtain the following theorem  The category of -graded Hopf dg- -modules  glossar y   is equipped with the structure of a cofibrantly generated model category such that a morphism is a weak-equivalence  respectively a cofibration  if defines a weak-equivalence  respectively a cofibration  in the category of dg- -modules   Reedy model category of Hopf -modules   Hopf -module Reedy model category of Hopf -modules  This model structure for Hopf -modules is also cofibrantly generated  To be more explicit  as in the ground category of dg-modules  we have the following lemma  We have a generating set of cofibrations  respectively acyclic cofibrations  in the category of Hopf -modules defined by morphisms C otimes Lambda r oplus  C otimes Latch  Lambda r   D otimes Latc h Lambda r  arrow D otimes Lambda r associated to a generating set of cofibrations  respectively acyclic cofibrations  of the category of dg-coalgebras  Recall simply that the forgetful functor creates colimits in the category of coalgebras so that the tensor products where is a -set  as well as the coproducts have the same realization in the category of dg-coalgebras as in the category of dg-modules

 The fibrations can be characterized by the right lifting property as usual but  as in the context of dg-modules  one can introduced an appropriate matching object in the category of Hopf -modules so that a morphism of Hopf -modules is a fibration if and only if the morphisms   mu p   C r  arrow Matc hC  r  mes   Match D  r   D r  define a fibration in the category of dg-coalgebras for all   Reedy fibration of Hopf -modules   fibration Reedy fibration of Hopf -modules  The matching object of a Hopf -module  glossar y    Hopf -module matching object of a   matching object of a Hopf -module  is defined by the same limit as in the category of dg-modules  Matc hC  r     lim   alpha   underline r   xrightarro w<  underlin er   C r    where ranges over morphisms such that except that we perform this limit in the category of dg-coalgebras  This matching object can also be defined by an equalizer as in the category of dg-modules  but an equalizer of dg-coalgebras  Namely   Matc hC  r     ker l  xymatri x   <2mm>  prod  1 q i q r  C r-1   ar <2pt> r   d 0  ar <-2pt> r   d 1  	   <2mm > prod  1 q i<j q r  C r-2     r    medskip As in the context of -modules  we have an induced model structure on the subcategory of formed by non-unital Hopf -modules  First  we observe that the adjunction relation of proposition prop ConnectedAdjoints can be extended in the coalgebra context so that we have an adjunction ladder   xymatri x g Lambda   op    HopfMod 0 ar r    r   Lambda  0  	 g Lambda   op    HopfMod ar <-6mm> l    ctr   Lambda  0  ar < 6mm> l    str   Lambda  0      glossar y   In fact  the non-unital object respectively associated to a Hopf -module respectively can be obtained as in the dg-module context except that in the definition of we perform the pullbacks  xymatri x  str   Lambda  0 D  r  ar  -->  r  ar  -->  d  	 D r  ar d    eta 0  
 0 ar r   0  	 D 0     in the category of coalgebras  As in the context of -modules  we observe that the functor preserves cofibrations and all weak-equivalences of Hopf -modules  Then we obtain  The category of -graded Hopf -modules forms a model subcategory of so that a morphism is a weak-equivalence  respectively a cofibration  a fibration  in if and only if defines a weak-equivalence  respectively a cofibration  a fibration  in  Furthermore  this category is cofibrantly generated by the morphisms associated to a generating set of cofibrations  respectively acyclic cofibrations  in  As in the ground category of dg-modules  we obtain that the functor  str   Lambda  0  g Lambda   op    HopfMod arrow g Lambda   op    HopfMod 0 preserves fibrations  acyclic fibrations and weak-equivalences between fibrant objects by adjunction  The category of unitary objects is also equipped with the canonical model structure of a comma category   medskip Now we check that the results of subsection UnitalOperadsReedyModelStructure can be extended to the category of unital Hopf operads  Explicitly  the Reedy model structure of  non-unital  Hopf -modules can be transferred to unital Hopf operads through the adjunction  FOp    g Lambda     op  HopfMod 1 0 leftarrows g HopfOp 1     -   -  so that we obtain the following theorem  The category of -graded unital Hopf dg-operads is equipped with the structure of a cofibrantly generated model category such that a morphism is a weak-equivalence  respectively a fibration  if forms a Reedy weak-equivalence  respectively a Reedy fibration  in the category of Hopf -modules   Reedy model category of unital Hopf operads   Hopf operad Reedy model category of unital Hopf operads  As in the case of unital operads  we check simply that the assumptions of the transfer principle are satisfied  Essentially  we check the following property  Suppose given a pushout of unital Hopf operads  xymatri x  FOp   C  ar  >->    D-<0pt 4pt>  d   0 35  i   0 35   sim  ar r   f  	  P ar d   j
  FOp   D  ar r   g  	  Q pus h4    such that is a morphism of free operads induced by an acyclic cofibration of Hopf -modules  The morphism is a weak-equivalence as well  In fact  this property is clearly inherited from the category of unital operads since we observe in item HopfLambdaModules that the forgetful functor creates the free functor and the small colimits in the category of unital Hopf operads 
Connected unital Hopf operads
 As in the context of operads in dg-modules  we can consider connected unital Hopf operads  operad connected   Hopf operad connected  characterized by and the full category  glossar y   formed by these objects  The category embedding admits also a left and a right adjoint such that  glossar y   glossar y   glossar y   In fact  we can consider the underlying categories of unital unitary Hopf -modules which are associated to these operad categories and for which we have an adjunction ladder   xymatri x  Lambda   op    HopfMod     ar r    r 1    	  Lambda   op    HopfMod 1   ar <-6mm> l    ctr 1    ar < 6mm> l    str 1       Then one checks readily that the connected unital unitary Hopf -module respectively associated to an operad respectively forms a Hopf suboperad of respectively a quotient operad of and the maps and supply required adjoint functors at the operad level  The connected Hopf -module associated to a unital unitary Hopf -module can be defined by the same pullback diagrams as in the category of dg-modules  xymatri x  str 1   N  r  ar  -->  r  ar  -->  d  	 N r  ar d     eta i    i

Prospects  cellular operads
 As explained in the memoir introduction  one might be willing to extend the results of this section to operads equipped with a good cellular structure  In regard to our construction  a good notion is supplied by functor operads on an operad in Reedy categories  Explicitly  we assume that consists of a sequence of categories equipped with a Reedy decomposition where is a direct Reedy category  is an inverse Reedy category and consists of isomorphisms  preserved by the operad structure  Recall that an operad functor in a category consists of a functor equipped with a suitable generalization of an operad structure  see McClureSmithCosimplicial  The definitions of this section can be generalized to this context  One has simply to consider the appropriate generalization of the notion of a -module  functors where denotes a semi-direct product of categories  and the corresponding matching and latching structures 
On Boardman-Vogt  -construction

Introduction
 The model category structure implies the existence of Reedy cofibrant replacements in the category of unital Hopf operads  As long as we deal with abstract structure results this purely existence theorem meets our needs  But for effective issues we need to have explicit cofibrant replacements  For the sake of completeness  we do not really use the constructions of this section in the memoir  and for subsequent references  we introduce in this section a differential graded analogue of the Boardman-Vogt -construction that fulfils this need  Explicitly  we define a functor from the category of connected unital dg-operads to itself  endowed with the following features   Compare with Berger-Moerdijk BergerMoerdijkW Boardman-Vogt BoardmanVogt     2mm  em The operad  glossar y    Boardman-Vogt  construction is equipped with a natural morphism  glossar y   which is a weak-equivalence of dg-operads  em The operad is quasi-free as a unital operad  To be more explicit  the operad is defined by a free operad equipped with a differential elta  tial   FOp   W   P   arrow FOp   W   P   which is given by the addition of a homogeneous derivation determined by the operad structure of to the canonical differential induced by the internal differential of  Furthermore  the morphism associated to an operad morphism is the morphism of quasi-free operads induced by the morphism of -modules associated to  The morphism defines a cofibration in the Reedy model category of operads provided that forms a cofibration in the model category of -modules  em If an operad is equipped with the structure of a Hopf operad  then the associated -construction can still be equipped with a coassociative diagonal functorially in so that defines a functor from the category of connected unital Hopf operads to itself  Moreover  the augmentation defines a weak-equivalence of unital Hopf operads   Hopf operad Boardman-Vogt  construction of a  We refer to item WQuasiFree for the general definition of a quasi-free object in the category of unital operads  In fact  as observed by Berger-Moerdijk in BergerMoerdijkW an analogue of the Boardman-Vogt -construction can be defined in any monoidal model category equipped with a good interval  Our differential graded -construction can be identified with an instance of this general -construction for the category of dg-modules  respectively for the category of dg-coalgebras  On the other hand  the classical topological Boardman-Vogt -construction  introduced in BoardmanVogt is defined by a cellular complex  Our differential graded -construction is precisely the chain complex defined by this cellular object  In this section  we give a precise account of the definition of though this construction is not original  in order to give insights into the structure of this operad in the unital context  To be precise  we have to check that that yield cofibrant resolutions in the Reedy model category as stated in theorem thm WHopfOperad  An analogous statement for the adjoint model structure is proved in BergerMoerdijkW but  for our purpose  we give other arguments  The Boardman-Vogt construction is by definition a cellular object in the ground model category  In BergerMoerdijkW BoardmanVogt the authors deal only with this cellular structure  In this memoir  we prove that the Boardman-Vogt construction defines a cellular object in the category of operads  Explicitly  we prove the following theorem that implies the cofibrancy claim of theorem thm WHopfOperad   The Boardman-Vogt construction is the colimit of a sequence of  Hopf  operads     W  -1   P  xrightarro wj 0 W  0   P  xrightarro wj 1  ots  xrightarro wj d W d  P  xrightarro wj  d 1   ots

Cell metric trees
 In the topological context the space defined by Boardman-Vogt in BoardmanVogt is a cubical cellular complex formed by trees whose vertices are labeled with operations of and whose edges are equipped with a length  The authors of BergerMoerdijkW consider in fact a generalization of this cellular construction in other categories than topological spaces  As stated in the section outline  the aim of this subsection is to recall our conventions for tree structures  borrowed from OperadTextbook so that we can make precise the definition of  In addition we prove that the metric trees considered by Boardman-Vogt form a cellular complex endowed with good homotopical properties  Recall that we consider nothing but the chain complex of Boardman-Vogt  cellular construction  As a byproduct  one can observe simply that is equipped with a diagonal and forms a Hopf operad if is so because is defined by a cubical cellular complex 
The chain interval
 In this memoir we let  glossar y   denote the standard cellular complex of the topological interval  Explicitly  the dg-module is generated by elements in degree by an element in degree and is equipped with the differential such that  One should not be confused by this notation for a basis element because we consider only basis elements in  Recall that defines a cylinder object in the category of dg-modules  To be explicit  we have a morphism  glossar y    respectively  glossar y    that maps the ground field to the submodule respectively and an augmentation  glossar y   that cancels and such that  In addition we have a morphism of dg-modules induced by the map of the topological interval  Explicitly  this morphism satisfies  mu   x0    x0       x0   qquad mu   x01    x0      mu   x0    x01       x01   qquad  mu   x0    x1      mu   x1    x0      mu   x1    x1       x1  and vanishes in the other cases  Observe that is equipped with a coassociative diagonal defined by the classical formulas  Delta   x0       x0  otimes  x0   quad Delta   x1       x1  otimes  x1   quad and  quad Delta   x01       x0  otimes  x01      x01  otimes  x1   One checks readily that the morphisms and are morphisms of dg-coalgebras  Recall that  according to BergerMoerdijk the background of the Boardman-Vogt construction is provided by a monoidal model category equipped with an interval  The dg-module is precisely the standard interval in the category of dg-modules and in the category of dg-coalgebras   chain interval
Tree structures
 As specified in the introduction  for tree structures  we adopt the conventions of our article OperadTextbook and we refer to this reference for more precision  Recall that an -tree  tree  -tree    -tree  refers to an abstract tree defined by a set of vertices  glossar y   and by a set of edges  glossar y    oriented from a source to a target  equipped with one outgoing edge  the root  tree root of a   root of a tree  of the tree  that targets to an element denoted by and ingoing edges  the leaves  tree leaves of a   leaves of a tree  of the tree  in one-to-one correspondence with the elements of that give the source of these edges  see figure figure AbstractTree  Formally the source of an edge is specified by an element and the target by an element  For we assume that there is one and only one edge with source so that the functions define a tree properly  and we assume that there is one and only one edge such that so that this edge represents the root of the tree  The leaves of are the edges with source  Recall that the tree structure is uniquely determined by a partition  glossar y    indexed by the set characterized by if and only if and are respectively the source and the target of an edge of the tree  Hence the component associated to a vertex represents the set of entries of the vertex in the tree  In the example represented in figure figure MetricTree we have and  The set of internal edges  tree internal edge of a   internal edge of a tree  of the tree denoted by  glossar y    consists of the edges which are neither a leave or the root of  Thus an edge is internal if and only if
Tree morphisms and edge contractions
 In our construction we consider a category of -trees  denoted by  glossar y    in which a morphism is defined by a contraction of internal edges  Formally  a morphism of -trees  tree morphism of -trees   morphism of -trees  is defined by a pair of maps and endowed with the following properties  em the map is the identity on   em for an edge such that we have   em for an edge such that we have and  An example of a tree morphism is represented in figure figure AbstractTreeMorphism  In this example the map is defined by and  Observe that the previous assertions imply that the map is onto and induces a one-to-one correspondence between and  Moreover  the map is clearly uniquely determined by and conversely  Intuitively  the edges such that are contracted to the vertex by the morphism and the other edges are preserved  Our assumptions imply that the leaves and the root are fixed by a morphism of -trees and  as a consequence  only internal edges are allowed to be contracted  Furthermore  we can observe that the subsets and associated to a vertex determine a subtree of  In addition the entry set of can be identified with the image under the map of the entry set of this subtree  we refer to OperadTextbook for the formal definition of these notions   In fact  the tree can be determined by a generalization of the quotient process of OperadTextbook  Namely  if we perform a sequence of quotients by the subtrees for then we obtain the tree up to isomorphism  Clearly  a morphism of -trees is an isomorphism if and only if the map is one-to-one and defines a one-to-one correspondence between edge sets   tree isomorphism of -trees  One can also observe that a morphism of -trees that contracts a single edge is equivalent to the contraction process  glossar y   defined in OperadTextbook  To be precise  for an internal edge one considers the tree obtained by identifying the source and the target of in to a single vertex whose entries are defined by the union of the entries of and in  Hence we have and  Furthermore  the quotient map and the map such that and for defines a morphism of -trees which is called an edge contraction  edge contraction   tree edge contraction in a   As an example  the contraction of the edge in the tree of figure figure AbstractTree gives the tree represented in figure figure EdgeContraction  Clearly  a morphism of -trees is a composite of tree isomorphisms and edge contractions 
Tree categories
 We call a tree -reduced  tree  -reduced  if all vertices have more than entries  For instance  a tree is called -reduced if it has no terminal vertex  a vertex is terminal if  Observe that a -reduced -tree has no automorphism  Accordingly  if we fix a representative for each isomorphism class of -reduced tree  then we obtain a category  denoted by  glossar y    equivalent to the full subcategory of generated by -reduced trees in which all isomorphisms are identities  Hence any morphism in is a composite of edge contractions  Moreover  one can observe that defines a poset equipped with a terminal element represented by the unique -tree  glossar y   with one vertex and no internal edge  see figure figure TerminalTree  The category is also equipped with a natural grading given by the number of internal edges and we let  glossar y   denote the subcategory of generated by trees of grading  Observe that contains only of the terminal -tree  Clearly  any non-identity morphism of decreases the grading so that defines an inverse Reedy category  In fact  in the constructions of this section we consider only the subcategory of formed by -reduced -trees  Therefore we introduce the notation  glossar y   for this category and we let also  glossar y   denote the subcategory of formed by -reduced -trees with no more than internal edges 
Cell metric trees and length tensors
 In the definition of the Boardman-Vogt complex we consider cell metric trees  tree cell metric  equipped with a length tensor  length tensor  defined by a tensor product of interval elements indexed by the internal edges of   mbda   otimes  e in E  au   mbda e in otimes  e in E  au   I  In fact  we identify abusively a length tensor with a basis element of the tensor product so that a length tensor is defined by a map which associates to any internal edge an element  In the representation of a tree we decorate the internal edges by the corresponding length as in figure figure MetricTree  The module of length tensors  length tensor module of length tensors  is denoted by  Cub e au    otimes  e in E  au   I   glossar y   In fact  this module is nothing but the cellular complex of the cube build on the internal edges of the tree  One observes that the map can be extended to a contravariant functor from the category of trees to the category of dg-modules  Explicitly  a tree morphism induces a dg-module morphism that assigns the length to the edges which are contracted to a vertex by and preserves the length of the other edges which are mapped to an edge of  Formally  a morphism of trees yields a partition and induces a bijection from to  The dg-module morphism is given by the tensor product of the canonical isomorphism otimes  e  in E  au    I simeq otimes  e in f E  -1  E  au    I with the unit map otimes  e in f E  -1  V au    eta 0  otimes  e in f E  -1  V au    F  x0  arrow otimes  e in f E  -1  V au    I  Hence this morphism identifies the module  Cub e au     otimes  e  in E  au     I with the module of length tensors  Bigl  otimes  e in f E  -1  E  au    I Bigr  otimes Bigl  otimes  e in f E  -1  V au      x0  Bigr   subset otimes  e in E  au   I    Cub e au  in which the edges that are contracted to a vertex in have length  As an example  an edge contraction induces a dg-module morphism that identifies the module to the module of length tensors such that  Finally  as our chain interval equipped with a coassociative diagonal  defines an interval in the category of dg-coalgebras and not only to the category of dg-modules  we observe that the construction of this paragraph gives a functor from the category of trees to the category of dg-coalgebras as well  Explicitly  the diagonal of is given by the composite of tensor products of the diagonal of with the obvious tensor permutation  otimes  e in E  au   I arrow otimes  e in E  au     I otimes I   xrightarro w simeq  Bigl  otimes  e in E  au   I Bigr  otimes Bigl  otimes  e in E  au   I Bigr   Equivalently  in the definition of we consider a tensor product in the monoidal category of dg-coalgebras and not only in the category of dg-modules  The morphism induced by a tree morphism defines clearly a morphism of dg-coalgebras as the definition of can be deduced from the axioms of symmetric monoidal categories 
Coends over the category of trees
 In this section we consider coends  int   au in Theta   r    Phi  au otimes Cub e au  associated to covariant functors from the category of -reduced trees  see item TreeCategories  to the category of dg-modules  respectively dg-coalgebras  Recall that the coends in the category of dg-coalgebras are created in the category of dg-modules like all colimits  We aim to determine the homotopy type of these coends  We prove precisely that is homotopy equivalent to the object associated to the terminal -tree  We prove in addition that the coend morphism  phi     int   au in Theta   r    Phi  au otimes Cub e au  arrow int   au in Theta   r    Psi  au otimes Cub e au  induced by a functor morphism forms a cofibration  respectively an acyclic cofibration  if is a pointwise cofibration  respectively a pointwise acyclic cofibration  For these purposes we assume that the category of contravariant functors from the category of trees to the category of dg-modules  respectively to the category of dg-coalgebras  is equipped with a Reedy model structure  Explicitly  for contravariant functors we have a latching object  defined by  Latc hC   au    colim   au xrightarrow  not   au   C   au    and a functor morphism is a Reedy cofibration  respectively an acyclic Reedy cofibration  if and only if  for each tree the morphism   phi  mbda   C  au oplus   Latch C   au  Latc hD   au arrow D  au defines a cofibration  respectively an acyclic cofibration  in the ground category  Fibrations and weak-equivalences are defined pointwise  The definitions are dual for covariant functors but we do not consider fibrations and matching objects explicitly in this case  Recall that a morphism of dg-coalgebras is a cofibration  respectively an acyclic cofibration  if and only if it defines a cofibration  respectively an acyclic cofibration  in the category of dg-modules  The same statement holds for functor morphisms since colimits and latching objects in the category of dg-coalgebras are created in the category of dg-modules  As a byproduct  the dg-coalgebra case of the next statements is always an immediate consequence of the dg-module case  Therefore we give proofs in the context of dg-modules and omit to give more precision in the context of dg-coalgebras  On the other hand  one can observe that our assertions and our arguments can be extended to monoidal model categories including both the category of dg-modules and the category of dg-coalgebras  We deduce our results from forthcoming observations about the functor defined by the modules of length tensors 
Homotopy properties of the modules of length tensors
 We observe that the functor is connected to the constant functor by equivalences of functors on  To be more explicit  for each tree we have a morphism induced by  One checks readily that commutes with the morphisms induced by a tree morphism so that defines a morphism of functors on the category of trees  Similarly  one can check that the augmentation induces a morphism of functors such that  Finally  one can observe that and are coalgebra morphisms because so are and  We have the following assertion  The morphism is an acyclic Reedy cofibration in the category of contravariant functors from to the category of dg-modules  respectively to the category of dg-coalgebras  As a corollary  the morphism which is right inverse to defines a weak equivalence of functors as well  Recall that defines an acyclic Reedy cofibration if and only if the morphism   eta 0    mbda    F oplus   Latch  F   au  Latc h Cube  au   arrow Cub e au  defines an acyclic cofibration in the category of dg-modules for all  Clearly  for the constant functor we have if the terminal -tree  and  Hence we obtain  F oplus   Latch  F   au  Latc h Cube  au      Latc h Cube  au   quad if  qquad and  qquad F oplus   Latch  F    au r   Latc h Cube  au r      F    Cub e au r    Recall that since has no internal edge   Consequently  the morphism is an acyclic Reedy cofibration if an only if the canonical map is an acyclic cofibration of dg-modules  or dg-coalgebras  for  This assertion can be deduced from the axioms of monoidal model categories and from the general properties of an interval  On the other hand  in the framework of dg-modules one can observe simply that the dg-module is identified with the submodule of spanned by length tensors in which some edges have length  Consequently  the quotient can be identified with a tensor product of dg-modules which are clearly acyclic  By the way  we observe in this proof that the natural morphism  Latc h Cube  au    au     colim  f  au  xrightarrow  not   au   Cub e au   arrow Cub e au  defines an embedding from the latching object to  Accordingly  we have the following result  The functor defines a Reedy cofibrant object in the category of contravariant functors from the category of trees to the category of dg-modules  respectively to the category of dg-coalgebras  We can now prove the results announced in item TreeCoends  First  we have the following assertion that arises as a consequence of observation obsv LengthTensorsHomotopy   The coend morphism  eta 0     int   au in Theta   r   Phi  au otimes F arrow int   au in Theta   r   Phi  au otimes Cub e au  induced by defines an acyclic cofibration of dg-modules  respectively dg-coalgebras  As a consequence  the morphism which is right inverse to defines an inverse weak equivalence of dg-modules  respectively dg-coalgebras  silon     int   au in Theta   r   Phi  au otimes Cub e au   xrightarro w sim  int   au in Theta   r   Phi  au otimes F such that  To be explicit  recall that defines by observation obsv LengthTensorsHomotopy an acyclic Reedy cofibration of functors on  Accordingly  the claim is an instance of a general statement that can be deduced from the categorical definition of a coend and from the axioms of monoidal model categories  Explicitly  for a fibration of dg-modules the lifting problem  xymatri x  int   au in Theta   r   Phi  au otimes F ar r  ar d  	 C ar  ->>  d   p

The Boardman-Vogt construction
 As announced in the section introduction  the purpose of this subsection is to give a precise account of the Boardman-Vogt construction in the differential graded context and to prove the properties of this construction asserted in theorem thm WHopfOperad up to the cofibrancy claim in assertion  b   In our construction  we consider only connected unital operads such that and  In this context we set and so that is still a connected unital operad  In what follows we give first the definition of the dg-modules for  Then we define the partial composites for operations such that and we make a particular case for composites with unital operations  In view of the construction of BergerMoerdijkW the connectedness assumption is not necessary but simplifies our construction  The assertion  c  of theorem thm WHopfOperad the Hopf operad structure  arises from the definition of  Only assertions  a  and  b  require an actual proof supplied by claim claim WAugmentation and claim claim WQuasiFree respectively 
Treewise tensor products
  treewise tensor product  For a finite set we form the module  glossar y   whose elements represent operations in variables indexed by instead of the integers  For finite sets and an element we have a partial composite operation  As in OperadTextbook given a tree we let  glossar y   denote the module of tensors  ptensor   otimes  v in V au   p v in otimes  v in V au    P I v  that represent labelings of vertices of by operations whose variables are in bijection with the entry set of the associated vertex  In fact  we shall consider only -reduced trees whose vertices have all at least to entries  Thus  for the factors of a labeling  the set contains at least two elements   tree labeling of an -tree  One observes that the map can be extended to a covariant functor from the category of trees to the category of dg-modules  In particular  for each internal edge we have a natural morphism  mma  e 0      au  P  arrow au e 0  P  from the labellings of the tree to the labellings of the tree obtained by the contraction of the edge  In general a morphism induced by a tree morphism is a composite of edge contractions and isomorphisms  Therefore  for our purposes  it is sufficient to make the morphisms explicit  Let and denote respectively the source and the target of  By definition  the morphism preserves the label of vertices which are untouched by the contraction process and labels the collapsed vertex in by the partial composite of the labels of the vertices and in  see figure figure LabelledMetricTreeContraction  Clearly  for the terminal -tree we have a canonical isomorphism  Accordingly  for each -tree the terminal morphism induces a morphism  Intuitively  a tree labeling represents a formal operadic composite of operations and the morphism is defined by the evaluation of this composite operation in the operad  For a Hopf operad the construction of this paragraph gives a functor from the category of trees to the category of dg-coalgebras and not only to the category of dg-modules  Formally  in the definition of we consider a tensor product in the monoidal category of dg-coalgebras and not only in the category of dg-modules  as in the definition of the module of length tensors   Hence a morphism of -trees induces a coalgebra morphism since the definition of can be deduced from the axioms of symmetric monoidal categories and since a Hopf operad refers precisely to an operad in the category of coalgebras  Explicitly  for a fixed -tree the diagonal of is given by the composite of a tensor product of the internal diagonal of with the obvious tensor permutation  Thus  for an element we have  Delta  ptensor     sum  Bigl  otimes  v in V au   p  v Bigr  otimes Bigl  otimes  v in V au   p   v Bigr   in au  P  otimes au  P   where we consider the expansion of the diagonal of each factor  Accordingly  the diagonal of a labeling is represented by the graphical formula of figure figure LabelledTreeDiagonal
The -construction
 In this paragraph we define the chain structure of the Boardman-Vogt operad  As specified in the subsection introduction  we set and so that is still a connected unital operad  Consequently  in this paragraph and in the next ones  we consider only the components such that and we define the structure of the reduced operad associated to  The definition of the partial composition products with unital operations is postponed to item WUnitComposites  For the module is defined by the dg-module coend W  P  r     int   au in Theta   r   au  P  otimes Cub e au  in which the variable ranges over the category of -reduced -trees introduced in item TreeCategories  The map defines clearly a functor on the category of dg-operads  Equivalently  the module can be defined by the direct sum W  P  r    oplus   au in Theta   r   au  P  otimes Cub e au   equiv together with the relation  ptensor otimes f   mbda equiv f   ptensor otimes mbda for any -tree morphism  Clearly  the relation is generated by the relations associated to edge contractions since any morphism of is a composite of edge contractions  Recall that the morphism identifies with the submodule of length tensors such that  Thus  intuitively  the relation identifies an element equipped with an edge of length to an element obtained by the contraction of as represented in figure figure LabelledMetricTreeContraction  Accordingly  in the context of dg-modules  any element of has a normal form for a uniquely determined tree such that or for all internal edges  Finally  we observe that is a dg-coalgebra if is a Hopf operad  Indeed we observe in this section that the functor targets to the category of coalgebras and not only to the category of dg-modules as well as the functor if is a Hopf operad  Our claim follows since the forgetful functors from the category of coalgebras to the category of dg-modules creates coends  These observations prove also that  for a Hopf operad  the general definition of deduced from monoidal model category axioms agrees with our elementary construction of within the category of dg-modules  Explicitly  in order to define the diagonal of an element in we can simply put together the diagonal of represented in figure figure LabelledTreeDiagonal with the diagonal of in the cubical complex as in the representation of figure figure MetricTreeDiagonal
The cellular differential in the -construction
 We make explicit the differential of an element of  By definition  the module is equipped with a natural differential induced by the internal differential of the operad and with a cellular differential induced by the differential of the chain interval  Explicitly  this cellular differential replaces an edge length by a difference  The cellular differential of an explicit element of is represented in figure figure CellBoundaryMetricTree  We have unspecified signs determined by an orientation of the cell associated to the tree equivalent to an ordering of the length tensors since the differential is supposed to operate on the module according to the rules of differential graded algebra  Notice that  according to these definitions  the dg-module forms a cubical complex whose cells are indexed by -reduced -trees 
The operad structure of the -construction
 Observe that comes equipped with a natural action of the symmetric group given by the leaf reindexing of -trees as usual  In this paragraph we define the operadic composition products  circ i  W  P  s  otimes W  P  t  arrow W  P  s t-1  for and this definition gives the structure of the reduced operad  The partial composition product is deduced from the grafting process of rooted trees extended to cell metric trees  To begin with we recall the definition of the tree obtained by grafting the root of a -tree to the th leaf of an -tree  Formally  the vertex set of is defined by the union of the vertices of and and the edge set by the union of the edges of and in which the root of and the th leaf of are identified  For this new edge we set and  The other edges and keep the same source and target in  The leaves of are reindexed as usual so that our construction produces an -tree from an -tree and a -tree  Observe that the internal edges of are either internal edges of and or produced by the grafting of the root of with the th leaf of  Consequently  we have a natural morphism  circ i   Cub e sigma  otimes Cub e au  arrow Cub e sigma circ i au  that assigns the length to the new internal edge and preserves the length of the other edges of  Formally  we have a partition and the morphism is defined by  Bigl  otimes  e in E   sigma   I Bigr  otimes Bigl  otimes  e in E  au   I Bigr   xrightarro w Id otimes eta 1   Bigl  otimes  e in E   sigma   I Bigr  otimes Bigl  otimes  e in E  au   I Bigr  otimes F  x1   hookrightarrow otimes  e in E   sigma circ i au   I  One checks readily that this definition gives a morphism of functors in  On the other hand  we have also a natural isomorphism  circ i   sigma  P  otimes au  P  xrightarro w simeq  sigma circ i au  P  since  The pairing of these morphisms gives the required composition product on  The representation of this grafting process is given by figure figure GraftingMetricTree  One checks readily that the maps satisfy the associativity and commutativity properties of partial composition products of an operad  Clearly  the only example of a reduced -tree is provided by the unit tree equipped with an empty set of vertices and only one edge  This object defines a unit for the partial composition products defined in this paragraph  Accordingly  for we can extend the definition of item WComplex in order to obtain coherently with our conventions  Observe that the definition of can be deduced from the axioms of symmetric monoidal categories so that this morphism defines a morphism of coalgebras if is a Hopf operad  Similarly  the morphism defines a morphism of coalgebras and not only of dg-modules because defines an interval in the category of coalgebras and not only in the category of dg-modules  From these observations we conclude that the operadic composition products of the -construction are morphism of coalgebras so that forms a Hopf operad  To conclude  for a Hopf operad our construction returns an operad in the category of dg-coalgebras  In fact  our construction agrees with the general construction of BergerMoerdijkW defined within the formalism of monoidal model categories  for the category of dg-coalgebras 
Unitary operations in the Boardman-Vogt construction
 We define now the partial composites with unital operations  circ i  W  P  r  otimes W  P  0  arrow W  P  r-1   As specified in the introduction  we set so that is still a connected unital operad  For our purpose we consider an expansion W  P  r    oplus   au  au  P  otimes Cub e au   equiv that ranges over all -trees  unlike the expansion of item WComplex but which contains more relations so that this expansion returns the same result for and for  Roughly  we put relations so that any labeling reduces to the labeling of a reduced tree for or to an element of for  Explicitly  let denote a tree equipped with a vertex such that is empty and let denote the unique edge such that  Thus  for a labeling we have  An element is set to be equivalent to an element of the summand for the tree obtained by contraction of the edge according to the process of item TreeMorphisms  By definition  the terminal vertex disappears in  Explicitly  we consider the morphism defined in item WComplex and we let denote the dg-module morphism induced by the augmentation on the factor of the tensor product indexed by the edge  Recall that so that we have a morphism  Bigl  otimes  e in E  au  setminus e 0    I Bigr  otimes I  xrightarro w Id otimes silon  Bigl  otimes  e in E  au  setminus e 0    I Bigr   xrightarro w   otimes  e in E  au e 0   I  For a tensor we set precisely  ptensor otimes mbda equiv mma  e 0      ptensor  otimes mma  e 0     mbda   Let denote a tree equipped with a vertex such that has only one element and let respectively denote the unique edge such that respectively  For a labeling the element denotes necessarily the operad unit  We consider the tree in which the vertex is removed  Formally  this tree is defined by the vertex set and by the quotient edge set in which the edges and are identified  An element is set to be equivalent to an element of the summand  Namely we set  ptensor otimes mbda equiv elta  v 0      ptensor  otimes elta  v 0     mbda  for morphisms and obtained as follows  Since we have an isomorphism otimes  v in V au    P I v  xrightarro w simeq  otimes  v in V au  setminus v 0    P I v  which yields the required morphism  Equivalently  the tensor is obtained simply by removing the unit element from  The length tensor is defined by for and for the other edges of  To be precise  the edges are not necessarily internal  In this case we set by convention   subsubsectio nThe homotopy type of the -construction -- assertion  a  of theorem thm WHopfOperad   In this paragraph we define the operad equivalence specified in the claim  a  of theorem thm WHopfOperad  Recall that the module of length tensors is equipped with natural equivalences  F xrightarro w eta 0    Cub e au  xrightarro w silon    F such that and is an acyclic Reedy cofibration  Furthermore  by lemma lemm TreewiseCoends these morphisms yield inverse equivalences of dg-modules  respectively dg-coalgebras in the Hopf operad context    xymatri x    isplaystyle au r

Consequently  we obtain morphisms of dg-modules  respectively dg-coalgebras  and such that and which are endowed with the following properties  The morphism defines an acyclic cofibration of dg-modules  respectively dg-coalgebras  As a consequence  the morphism which is right inverse to defines a weak equivalence of dg-modules  respectively dg-coalgebras  as well  We check that defines indeed an operad equivalence  In fact  one can obtain a more elementary definition for and  Namely the morphism identifies an operation with an element of the summand of associated to the terminal -tree  In the converse direction  for a tensor  ptensor otimes mbda    Bigl  otimes  v in V au   p v Bigr   otimes Bigl  otimes  e in E  au   mbda e Bigr   in au  P  otimes Cub e au   we have if for an edge  Otherwise  if or for all edges then the morphism performs the composite of the operations in  According to this elementary definition  we obtain  The morphism defines a morphism of unital  Hopf  operads  and finally   Assertion  a  of theorem thm WHopfOperad   The morphism defines a weak-equivalence of unital  Hopf  operads  Notice that does not form an operad morphism and give only a left inverse of in the category of dg-modules  respectively dg-coalgebras if is a Hopf operad   subsubsectio nThe quasi-free operad property -- assertion  b  of theorem thm WHopfOperad   In the differential context  we have a natural notion of a quasi-free object in the category of unital operads  Explicitly  a quasi-free unital operad is specified by a pair and represents a free operad equipped with a non-canonical differential obtained by the addition of a homogeneous derivation of degree tial   FOp   M  arrow FOp   M  to the natural differential of the free operad induced by the internal differential of  In this paragraph we define a graded -module such that as claimed by assertion  b  of theorem thm WHopfOperad  In fact  this -module is defined by a section of the indecomposable quotient of  The construction of this paragraph makes sense only in the differential graded context and not in the general framework of BergerMoerdijkW in which a Boardman-Vogt construction can be defined  By definition  an element is decomposable for the operadic composition product of if and only if the length tensor contains edges of length  Therefore we consider the graded module spanned by length tensors such that or for all  This module is not preserved by the differential of but defines a section of the quotient dg-module of in which length tensors that contain edges of length are canceled  By an abuse of notation  we identify the section with this quotient dg-module so that we have a natural morphism of dg-modules  Then let W   P  r     int   au in Theta   r   au  P  otimes IntCub e au   Clearly  the quotient morphism induces a morphism of dg-modules that identifies the module with the indecomposable quotient of  On the other hand  the embedding induces an embedding of graded modules so that represents a section of the indecomposable quotient of the operad  One checks easily that is preserved by the operadic composites supplied by the construction of item WUnitComposites  Consequently  the module forms a graded -submodule of   Assertion  b  of theorem thm WHopfOperad   The embedding of graded -modules induces an isomorphism of graded operads  Consequently  the operad is quasi-free and we have W  P      FOp   W   P    tial  for an operad derivation  In fact  for an element the edges of length form the edges of a tree whose vertices are the subtrees of cut by these edges precisely  This process identifies the tensor with an operadic composite of elements of arranged on a tree and hence with an element of the free operad generated by according to the classical construction of the free operad  Therefore we have an isomorphism as stated  To be more precise  notice that the interval differential admits a splitting such that and  Clearly  the component of the interval differential preserves the module and defines the differential of the associated quotient module  As a consequence  the cellular differential of the -construction is endowed with a similar splitting the component preserves and is decomposable  Hence the indecomposable quotient of can be identified with the graded module equipped with a cellular differential defined by  In fact  the suspended dg-module can be identified with the operadic bar construction introduced in GetzlerJones  see also OperadTextbook GinzburgKapranov   and can be identified with the cobar-bar construction of  In the topological context the suspension of the -space defined by the operadic indecomposable quotient of is homeomorphic to the bar construction defined in Ching but the relation with fails in this context  Clearly  the module is preserved by the morphism induced by an operad morphism  Hence the map has the functoriality property claimed by assertion  b  of theorem thm WHopfOperad  As explained in the introduction  we deduce the cofibrancy claim from theorem thm BoardmanVogtOperadicCellularDecomposition
The cellular decomposition of the -construction
 In this subsection we define the operadic cellular decomposition of the operad announced by theorem thm BoardmanVogtOperadicCellularDecomposition  Namely we specify suboperads such that together with -submodules and so that we have an operad pushout  xymatri x  FOp   C d  P   ar r   f d  ar d   i d  	 W  d-1   P  ar d   j d

Skeletal filtration and decomposition of length tensors
 For our purposes we give another equivalent definition of  This new definition can also be generalized to the framework of BergerMoerdijkW unlike the previous construction of  First  we need to introduce a skeletal filtration of which is defined by the submodules spanned by the length tensors of degree  In a general framework the module is defined by a colimit of tensor products of the form  Bigl  otimes e F  x0  Bigr   otimes Bigl  otimes e F  x1  Bigr   otimes Bigl  otimes e I Bigr  subset otimes  e in E  au   I with no more than factors  Then  for an element we observe that the relation is equivalent to a condition on the length tensor only like the characterization of a decomposable element given in item WQuasiFree  Explicitly  as explained in the proof of claim claim WQuasiFree the edges of length decomposes the length tensor into a composite of elements for subtrees arranged on a tree  By definition  we have if and only if these length tensors satisfy for all  To make our construction more general  we introduce a submodule spanned by decomposable tensors such that  Formally  this dg-module can be defined by a colimit process  For each decomposition of a tree into subtrees as above  we consider the tensor product otimes  u in V  sigma   sk d Cub e au u   By definition  we have  Consequently  we have an embedding  eta 1    otimes  u in V  sigma   sk d Cub e au u  arrow otimes  e in E  au   I    Cub e au  given by on the factors associated to an edge  Furthermore  for each decomposition refinement  we have a similar morphism otimes  u  in V  sigma    sk d Cub e au   u    arrow otimes  u in V  sigma   sk d Cub e au   u    that commutes with these embeddings  given by on the factors associated to an edge e in coprod  u  E  au u  setminus coprod  u   E  au   u     The module is defined by the colimit of these morphisms for all decompositions into subtrees  This module is endowed with a natural embedding induced by the embeddings above  The assumption ensures that a length tensor that arises in this colimit satisfies  The colimit process permits to identify an element that contains an edge of length to a further decomposition  Hence any element of is equivalent to a representative such that  To conclude  we obtain  We have W d  P  r     int   au in Theta   r   au  P  otimes ec d Cub e au   Furthermore  observe that we have an isomorphism for any pair of trees and  Consequently  the composition product of can be obtained by a generalization of the construction of item MetricTreeOperadicComposite for the operad   medskip For our next construction  we record the following assertion which is a tautological consequence of the definition of the modules   For a tree we have natural embeddings  xymatrix R 6m m ar     d  	  ar     d

  FOp D d  P   ar r   g d  	  FOp W    d  P     form a pushout  Our claim follows immediately from this assertion  For a proof of claim claim WCellExtensions in the general framework of BergerMoerdijkW we use the coend representation of supplied by observation obsv WCellularFiltration  One can observe further that the free operad is given by a coend of tensor products otimes u au u  P  otimes sk d Cub e au u   where ranges over collection of trees in arranged on a tree  This assertion follows from a straightforward interchange of colimits  In addition the map can be identified with a coend morphism induced by canonical morphisms otimes u au u  P  otimes sk d Cub e au u  arrow rho  P  otimes ec d Cub e rho   where is a tree formed by a composite of the trees along  The free operad and the attaching map have a similar representation  Then one can use a treewise representation of operadic composites in order to check by hand that satisfies the universal property of an operad pushout   Second part of theorem thm BoardmanVogtOperadicCellularDecomposition   The morphism of unitary  Hopf  -modules  i d  phi   C d  P   oplus  C d  P   D d  P  arrow D d  P   associated to an operad morphism is a weak-equivalence  respectively a Reedy cofibration  if defines a weak-equivalence  respectively a Reedy cofibration  in the category of  Hopf  -modules  This statement is valid in the framework of BergerMoerdijkW like claim claim WCellExtensions but for simplicity we give arguments that make sense only in the differential graded context  Consider the module introduced in the proof of claim claim WCellExtensions spanned by tensors such that and for all edges  Recall that these modules form a -module and we have a natural splitting  In fact  the -module equipped with a differential induced by the internal differential of can be identified with a quotient object of so that we have a short exact sequence  xymatri x C d  P  ar  >->    R <4pt 0pt>  r  	 D d  P  ar  ->>  r  	 E d  P     Observe that the coproduct admits a similar splitting C d  P   oplus  C d  P    D d  P    C d  P   oplus E d  P  so that the morphism of the claim fits a diagram of short exact sequences of dg-modules  xymatri x C d  P   ar  >->    R <4pt 0pt>  r  ar d      	 C d  P   oplus  C d  P    D d  P  ar  ->>  r  ar d    i d  phi   	 E d  P  ar d    phi

Construction of Hopf operad actions

Cofree coalgebras and quasi-cofree Hopf -modules

Introduction
 The goal of this section is to introduce a suitable notion of cocellular complex in order to obtain an effective class of fibrations in the category of Hopf operads  Our cocellular objects do not clearly generate the class of fibrations in the category of Hopf algebras but the Hopf operad of bar operations defined in the next section  our main device for the construction of operad actions  has such a cocellular structure  Hence the framework introduced in this section enables us to prove that the functor maps fibrations  respectively acyclic fibrations  of dg-operads to fibrations  respectively acyclic fibrations  of unital Hopf operads  This assertion allows us to deduce the existence of operad morphisms from model category arguments  For simplicity  we perform our constructions in the category of coalgebras first and we extend our definitions to Hopf -modules next  In our constructions  we consider -graded objects which are outside the coalgebra model category considered in section UnitaryHopfOperads  Thus  for our purposes  we have to extend the notion of a fibration and of an acyclic fibration to this context  In fact  we deal with lifting problems  xymatri x A ar r  ar d   i  	 C ar d   q

Cofree coalgebras
 As stated  the aim of this subsection is to recall categorical properties of augmented coassociative coalgebras  For our needs the main issue is to give an effective construction of cofree objects  For the sake of precision  we state the definition of these objects in a proposition   cofree coalgebra   coalgebra cofree  Any dg-module has an associated cofree augmented coassociative coalgebra  glossar y   equipped with a morphism of dg-modules  glossar y   characterized by the classical universal property  Namely any morphism of dg-modules where is a coalgebra has a unique factorization such that  glossar y   is a coalgebra morphism  We refer to Sweedler for a proof of this result in the case of non-graded coalgebras  to GetzlerGoerss for the case of non-negatively graded coalgebras and to SmithJustin for a generalization in the context of coalgebras over an operad  In this subsection we give an explicit realization of which is a special instance of the construction of the latter reference in the case of coassociative coalgebras  As such this subsection does not contain any original idea and our account is only motivated by the applications of the next subsection  As explained in the introduction  we have to deal with -graded coalgebras  Therefore we prove proposition prop CofreeCoalgebras in this framework  On the other hand  our assertion holds in both the category of -graded coalgebras and the category of -graded coalgebras  In fact  if is an -graded dg-module  then the associated cofree object in the category -graded coalgebras turns out to be -graded and gives also a realization of the cofree object cogenerated by in the category of -graded coalgebras 
An inductive construction
 We define a nested sequence of dg-modules  xymatri x    ots  ar      ->    R <4pt 0pt>  r  L-<2pt 0pt> 	    Gamma  r 1  V   ar      ->    R <4pt 0pt>  r  L-<2pt 0pt> 	    Gamma  r  V   ar      ->    R <4pt 0pt>  r  L-<2pt 0pt> 	    ots  ar      ->    R <4pt 0pt>  r  L-<2pt 0pt> 	    Gamma  1  V     prod  n 0    infty  V   otimes n     and we prove that the module is equipped with a coalgebra structure and represents the cofree coalgebra cogenerated by  The modules are defined by induction  We consider the natural map  xymatri x   prod  m  V   otimes m   otimes  prod  n  V   otimes n   ar r    nabla  Pi  	  prod  m n  V   otimes m  otimes V   otimes n     and the composite  xymatri x  prod  N  V   otimes N  ar r   0 3    Delta N    ar u r   4pt rr    Delta  Pi   d rr  U 	  prod  N   prod  m n   N  V   otimes m  otimes V   otimes n   ar r   0 55   simeq  	  prod  m n  V   otimes m  otimes V   otimes n      where denotes the deconcatenation of tensors  In general  the natural map is an embedding provided that the module is free over the ground ring  Accordingly  in our context  the map is always injective since our ground ring is supposed to be a field  Notice that the map is injective as well  For we set  By induction  we have a module equipped with an embedding  The next module is defined by the fiber product  xymatri x  Gamma  r 1  V  pul l6   ar  -->  d  ar  -->  r  	  Gamma  r  V  otimes Gamma  r  V  ar d    nabla  Pi cdot iota r otimes iota r

 In the differential graded context  the cofree coalgebra is equipped with a natural differential induced by the internal differential of  As explained in the introduction of this section  we consider quasi-cofree coalgebra  coalgebra quasi-cofree   quasi-cofree coalgebra  structures defined by a cofree coalgebra equipped with a coderivation such that defines the differential of  The following useful assertion generalizes a classical result for the tensor coalgebra  For any homogeneous morphism there is a unique coderivation such that  glossar y   Assume that the morphism is homogeneous of degree  The sum defines a differential on so that defines a quasi-cofree coalgebra if and only if we have the relation elta  alpha     alpha tial  alpha   0 in  Furthermore  the morphism of graded coalgebras  glossar y   induced by a homogeneous morphism of degree defines a morphism of differential graded coalgebras where if and only if we have the relation elta f     alpha nabla f   0 in  The construction of is similar to the construction of the coalgebra morphism associated to a morphism of dg-modules  In particular  we deduce the existence of from our realization of the cofree coalgebra  Explicitly  we consider the morphism which maps an element to the collection   pi   otimes i-1  otimes  alpha otimes pi   otimes n-i  cdot Delta n mma    One checks readily that this morphism fits a commutative diagram  xymatri x  Gamma V  ar r  ar d    widehat  tial   alpha  	  Gamma V  otimes Gamma V  ar d    nabla  Pi cdot  widehat  tial   alpha otimes 1 1 otimes wideha t tial   alpha

Quasi-cofree Hopf -modules
 The purpose of this subsection is to extend the constructions of the previous section to the category of Hopf -modules  First  observe that the category of Hopf -modules is endowed with a cofree object functor  In fact  the cofree Hopf -module  cofree Hopf -module   Hopf -module cofree   glossar y   associated to a -module can be defined explicitly by the cofree coalgebras  Gamma M  r     Gamma M r   on the dg-modules  Furthermore  the operations can be identified with the morphisms of cofree coalgebras induced by the operations on  For our purposes we extend the notion of a quasi-cofree object to Hopf -modules  Then we observe that the categorical results of the previous section hold as well for Hopf -modules  Finally  we obtain useful sufficient condition for a map to be a fibrations and acyclic fibrations in that category 
Quasi-cofree Hopf -modules
 As usual  in the differential graded framework  the cofree Hopf -module is equipped with a natural differential induced by the internal differential of  The structure of a quasi-cofree Hopf -module  quasi-cofree Hopf -module   Hopf -module quasi-cofree  is defined by a pair  Gamma     Gamma M   tial  alpha  where is a -module  denotes the associated cofree Hopf -module and denotes a homogeneous morphism of -modules which forms a coderivation with respect to the coalgebra structure so that the sum defines the differential of the Hopf -module  The coderivation  glossar y   is defined by a collection of coderivations of cofree coalgebras which in turn can be specified by a collection of homogeneous maps  As specified in the definition  the coderivation is supposed to define a homogeneous morphism of -modules  Thus we assume explicitly that commutes with the action of and with the operations  One can assume equivalently that the permutations induce morphisms of quasi-cofree coalgebras and similarly for the operations  Observe that the matching objects of a quasi-cofree Hopf -module  matching object of a quasi-cofree Hopf -module  can be defined by the quasi-cofree coalgebras  Matc h Gamma  r      Gamma  Matc hM  r    tial  alpha   where is induced by the homogeneous map that fits the commutative diagrams  xymatri x  Gamma  Match M  r   ar r    alpha  ar d    nabla   tial i   	  Matc hM  r  ar d    tial i
  Gamma  Matc hM  r-1   ar r    alpha  	  Matc hM  r     for  Similarly  if a morphism of quasi-cofree Hopf -modules where and is induced by a morphism of -modules then we have  Matc h Gamma  r  mes   Match  Gamma   r   Gamma  r      Gamma  Matc hM  r  mes   Match M   r   M  r    tial    alpha  alpha      Moreover  the morphism can be identified with the morphism of quasi-cofree coalgebras induced by the morphism of dg-modules
Coalgebra coextensions
 As in the case of coalgebras  we consider a morphism of quasi-cofree Hopf -modules  nabla f    Gamma M   tial  alpha  arrow  Gamma N   tial  beta  glossar y   induced by a morphism of dg-modules  Furthermore  we assume the existence of a lifting in a diagram of the form  xymatri x   Gamma M   tial  beta  ar r    pi   alpha   ar d    nabla f  	  Delta 1 wedge M ar r    sigma wedge M  	 S 1 wedge N ar d   S 1 wedge f
   Gamma M   tial  beta  ar r    pi   beta   ar  -->  urr    rho  	  Delta 1 wedge N ar r    sigma wedge N  	 S 1 wedge N    where the -modules are defined by  glossar y   and similarly for  glossar y    To be precise  we assume that defines a lifting in the category of dg-modules and hence commutes with the action of permutations and with the operations  Clearly  if is epi  then the existence of is equivalent to the existence of a lifting map in the diagrams  xymatri x  Gamma M r   ar r    alpha  ar d    nabla f  	 M r  ar d   f
  Gamma N r   ar r    beta  ar  -->  ur  	 N r     for  The epimorphism assumption implies that commutes automatically with differentials and with -module operations  Anyway  as in the case of coalgebras  we have a diagram of Hopf -modules  xymatrix C 16m m   Gamma M   tial  alpha  ar r    nabla   pi   alpha    ar d    nabla f  	  Gamma  Delta 1 wedge M  ar d     nabla   Delta 1 wedge f   nabla   sigma wedge M

Functorial coextensions
 Finally  we give also a relative version of this result in the context of Hopf -modules  We consider a commutative square of morphisms of quasi-cofree Hopf -modules  xymatri x   Gamma M   tial   alpha   ar d    nabla  f   ar r    nabla v  	   Gamma M    tial   alpha    ar d    nabla  f

 N ar r   w  	 N     As in the case of coalgebras  we assume the existence of functorial liftings and of the coderivation maps  Naturally we still assume that and form -module morphisms  Furthermore  if and are epi  then these functoriality requirements are automatically satisfied  In the situation of item DiagramCofreeLambdaModuleCoextensions if the morphism  nabla w    Gamma N   tial  beta  arrow  Gamma N    tial   beta    is a Reedy fibration of Hopf -modules and is a Reedy fibration of -modules  then  nabla v    Gamma M   tial  alpha  arrow  Gamma M    tial   alpha    is also a Reedy fibration of Hopf -modules  If we assume furthermore that and are weak-equivalences so that forms an acyclic Reedy fibration of Hopf -modules and forms an acyclic Reedy fibration of -modules  then forms an acyclic Reedy fibration of Hopf -modules as well  As in the case of coalgebras  one can observe that the weak-equivalence property for is satisfied as soon as we assume that forms an acyclic Reedy fibration of -modules and is a weak-equivalence  One can prove this lemma by a tedious but straightforward generalization of the arguments involved in the case of coalgebras  On the other hand  by definition  the morphism forms a Reedy fibration  respectively an acyclic Reedy fibration  in the category of Hopf -modules if and only if the morphism  nabla    mu v      Gamma M r    tial  alpha  arrow  Gamma  Matc hM  r  mes   Match M   r   M  r    tial    alpha  alpha     forms a fibration in the category of dg-coalgebras  Accordingly  our claims can also be deduced from the statement of lemma lemm DiagramCofreeCoextensionFibrations applied to the coalgebra morphisms  xymatri x   Gamma M r    tial   alpha   ar d    nabla  f   ar r   0 3   nabla    mu v    	   Gamma  Matc hM  r  mes   Match M   r   M  r    tial    alpha  alpha     ar d    nabla  f

Hopf endomorphism operads

Introduction and sketch of the section results
 The main results of this memoir are proved in this section  For that reason we give in this introduction a detailed summary of the content of this section  Thus we give precisions on the memoir objectives recalled from the memoir introduction  As in Bar1 we let  glossar y   denote the chain -operad of Stasheff s associahedra  We consider operads equipped with a fixed operad morphism so that we can extend the bar construction to the category of -algebras  To be more precise  as explained in the introduction of section UnitaryHopfOperads it is natural to assume that is a non-unitary algebra and hence to consider the non-unital version of the -operad and a non-unital operad under  Otherwise we have to replace the algebra by its augmentation ideal and the operad by the associated reduced operad  Recall that the tensor coalgebra cogenerated by the suspended dg-module  The differential of is the sum of the internal differential of with an additional component defined by a coalgebra coderivation such that tial a 1 otimes ots otimes a n     sum  r 2  n sum  k 1   n-r 1   pm a 1 otimes ots otimes mu r a k  ots a  k r-1   otimes ots otimes a n  where the  s are the standard generators of Stasheff s operad  These operations can abusively be identified with their image under the operad morphism  The bar complex is equipped with a canonical unit and forms a connected augmented unitary coalgebra 
The Hopf endomorphism operad of the bar complex
 The first goal of this section is to extend the endomorphism operad construction of Bar1 in the context of Hopf operads  More explicitly  we prove the following theorem  Let denote a  non-unital  operad in dg-modules equipped with an operad morphism where denotes Staheff s chain operad  There is a universal unital Hopf operad such that the bar complex of a -algebra is equipped with the structure of a Hopf algebra over functorially in  More precisely  the Hopf operad operates functorially on the coalgebra and so that the unital operation agrees with the unit of  Furthermore we have a one-to-one correspondance between such Hopf operad actions and morphisms of unital Hopf operads  The proof of this statement relies on the existence of internal hom-objects in the category of coalgebras  To be precise  as we consider on one hand the bar complex  which forms an augmented unitary coalgebra  and on the other hand the underlying coalgebras of a unital Hopf operad  which are supposed to form augmented but non-unitary coalgebras  we have to adapt our definitions  Explicitly  to any pair of augmented unitary coalgebras and we associate an augmented coalgebra such that a morphism is equivalent to a morphism of augmented coalgebras that makes the diagram  xymatri x K otimes F ar d   K otimes eta  ar r    silon  	  F ar d    eta
 K otimes L ar r    phi  	 M   commute  Then  for any coalgebra the objects form clearly a unital Hopf operad and a morphism of unital Hopf operads is equivalent to a Hopf operad action of on such that the unital operation agrees with the internal unit of the coalgebra  Formally  the endomorphism operad is defined by the end  HopfEnd B   P  r     int  A in P Alg  HopfHom B A    otimes r  B A    also denoted by  HopfEnd B   P  r     HopfHom  A in P Alg  B A    otimes r  B A    and where ranges over the category of -algebras  Roughly  the idea is to replace morphisms by natural transformations  The end construction permits simply to extend this process to internal hom-objects  According to this construction  we have a morphism  HopfEnd B   P  r  arrow HopfHom B A    otimes r  B A    for all so that operates on the bar complex functorially in  Thus the existence assertion of theorem thm BarHopfEndomorphismOperadRecall is a formal consequence of categorical properties of the category of coalgebras 
Fibration properties and contruction of operad actions
 The second goal of this section is to give more insights into the structure of so that we can prove the existence and uniqueness results stated in the introduction of this memoir  Let us outline our constructions more precisely  First  we observe that forms a quasi-cofree object in the category of Hopf -modules  Recall that a quasi-cofree Hopf -module is defined explicitly by a collection of cofree coalgebras associated to a -module and equipped with coderivations which preserve the -module structure  such that the differential of is given by the sum where is the natural differential of the cofree coalgebra induced by the internal differential of  For the Hopf endomorphism operad we obtain precisely  HopfEnd B   P      Gamma  PrimEnd B   P    tial  for the -module  PrimEnd B   P  r     DGHom  A in P Alg   Hom T c  Sigma A    otimes r   Sigma A  formed by all homogeneous morphisms which are functorial in  Then  as in Bar1 we introduce a smaller operad the Hopf operad of universal bar operations that behaves better than the endomorphism operad  As in the context of dg-modules  this operad is equipped with a split injective morphism which becomes an isomorphism if the operad is -cofibrant or if the ground field is infinite  Explicitly  one observes that the homogeneous morphisms associated to operations span a submodule of  The operad consists of quasi-cofree subcoalgebras of such that  HopfOp B   P  r      Gamma  PrimOp B   P  r    tial   One checks also that forms also a -submodule of so that forms a quasi-cofree Hopf -module  The endomorphism operad as well as is composed of -graded coalgebras unlike the Hopf operads considered in section UnitaryHopfOperads since a dg-module of homogeneous morphisms is naturally a -graded object  Similarly  one can observe that these operads are unital but non-connected  On the other hand  we consider only morphisms where is a non-negatively graded unital Hopf operad  One can check that the coalgebra truncation functor  glossar y   defined in subsection CofreeCoalgebras induces a truncation functor on operad categories so that a universal -graded unital Hopf operad is associated to any -graded unital Hopf operad  Accordingly  any morphism as above admits a factorization  xymatrix  C 6m m  Q ar  -->  dr  ar rr  	   HopfOp B   P
 	  str   g     HopfOp B   P   ar ur  	   and in the applications one can replace by the non-negatively graded operad  glossar y    If is connected  then we can consider a further factorization by a morphism where denotes the connected unital Hopf operad associated to by the construction of item ConnectedHopfOperads  For the sake of completness  recall that this functor preserves fibrations  acyclic fibrations and all weak-equivalences between fibrant objects  As in the previous section  we let a morphism of -graded unital Hopf operads be a Reedy fibration  respectively an acyclic Reedy fibration  if the associated morphism is so in the model category of non-negatively graded unital Hopf operads  Equivalently  the morphism is a Reedy fibration  respectively an acyclic Reedy fibration  if it has the left lifting property with respect to acyclic Reedy cofibrations  respectively Reedy cofibrations  of non-negatively graded unital Hopf operads   Reedy fibration of -graded Hopf operads   fibration of -graded Hopf operads  We prove that the Hopf operad of bar operations is endowed with the following property  The functor maps a fibration  respectively an acyclic fibration  of non-unital operads under to a Reedy fibration  respectively an acyclic Reedy fibration  of unital Hopf operads  In particular  the Hopf operad defines a fibrant object in the category of Hopf operads  for any operad under  One can observe that the Hopf endomorphism operad preserve fibrations like but not acyclic fibrations   medskip Recall that the commutative operad forms the final object of the category of unital Hopf operads  In the introduction of this memoir we mention that the classical shuffle product of tensors corresponds to a morphism  In the final part of this section we check that this morphism admits a factorization  xymatri x  C ar  -->  dr  UL   nabla  mma  ar r   0 35   nabla c  	  HopfEnd B   C

  C ar r   0 4   nabla  mma  	  HopfOp B   C    commutes automatically  For a commutative algebra it follows that the action of on reduces to the classical commutative operad action as claimed by theorem thm HopfExistenceUniquenessRecall   medskip The lifting process can be simplified if we assume that is a connected operad  Namely  if we apply the truncation functors  then  by theorem thm HopfOperadLifting our lifting problem becomes equivalent to  xymatri x 	  str 1   str   g     HopfOp B   E   ar  ->>  d    sim

Morphism coalgebras
 The purpose of this subsection is to construct morphism coalgebras that satisfy the adjunction property specified in the section introduction  Before we shall give precisions on the coalgebra categories that occur in the definition of
Augmented and unitary coalgebras
 In general we work within the category of augmented coassociative coalgebras denoted by  glossar y    But  as explained above  we consider also coalgebras in the category of non-augmented coalgebras  glossar y    in the category of augmented unitary coalgebras  glossar y   and in the category of connected coalgebras  glossar y    To be precise  an object  coalgebra augmented  denotes a coassociative coalgebra equipped with an augmentation defined by a morphism of coalgebras  glossar y     an object  coalgebra augmented unitary  denotes a coassociative coalgebra equipped with an augmentation and a coalgebra unit defined by a morphism of augmented coalgebra  The unit cokernel of a unitary coalgebra  glossar y   defines an object of  Clearly  the map defines an equivalence between the category of augmented unitary coalgebras and the category of non-augmented coalgebras  coalgebra non-augmented  since any augmented unitary coalgebra has a natural decomposition
Cofree unitary coalgebras
 The cofree coalgebra defined in the previous subsection is characterized by the adjunction relation  Hom   g Mod  K V     Hom   CoAlg a    K  Gamma V    for any augmented coalgebra  Notice that is equipped with a canonical unit induced by the null morphism  The unit cokernel of is denoted by  glossar y    One observes readily that the following adjunction relations hold  Hom   g Mod   overlin eL  V     Hom   CoAlg a   overlin eL   overlin e Gamma  V      Hom   CoAlg a    L  Gamma V    for any augmented unitary coalgebra  Accordingly  the cofree coalgebra forms also a cofree object in the category of augmented unitary coalgebras and its unit cokernel forms a cofree object in  Clearly  a morphism of cofree coalgebras preserves units if and only if the associated map cancels the unit of and hence is equivalent to a map  We consider also quasi-cofree objects in the category of augmented unitary coalgebras  We assume in this case that the coderivation cancels the unit of so that the unit morphism of the cofree coalgebra defines a morphism of dg-coalgebras  As in the context of coalgebra morphisms  it is equivalent to assume that the coderivation is induced by a map   medskip Recall that a tensor product of coassociative coalgebras is equipped with a natural coalgebra structure so that the coalgebra categories considered in this memoir are symmetric monoidal  In the language of monoidal categories  our internal morphism coalgebra  morphism coalgebra  glossar y   can be characterized by a closure property  In fact  we define by the following assertion  We have a bifunctor  HopfHom   CoAlg  a op    mes CoAlg a   arrow CoAlg a   that satisfies the adjunction relation  Hom   CoAlg a  K otimes overlin eL   overlin eM      Hom   CoAlg a    K  HopfHom L M    for all augmented coalgebras and all augmented unitary coalgebras  Recall that the forgetful functor from a coalgebra category to the category of dg-modules creates colimits  This assertion implies immediately that the functor preserves colimits  On the other hand  we mention in subsection CofreeCoalgebras that the category of coalgebras is equipped with a set of generating objects  Consequently  the proposition can be deduced from the special adjoint functor theorem  Nevertheless we prefer to give another proof of proposition prop CoalgebraHom so that we can obtain an explicit construction of in the case of a quasi-cofree coalgebra  Before observe that the adjunction relation of the proposition is equivalent to the adjunction property specified in the section introduction  More explicitly  we have the following assertion  Let denote an augmented coalgebra  Let be augmented unitary coalgebras as in proposition prop CoalgebraHom  We have a one-to-one correspondance bewteen morphisms of augmented coalgebras that make the diagram  xymatri x K otimes F ar r    silon  ar d   K otimes eta  	  F ar d    eta
 K otimes L ar r    phi  	 M   commute and morphisms of non-augmented coalgebras such that is defined by the restriction of to the summand of the tensor product  Hence a morphism of augmented coalgebras is equivalent to a morphism of augmented coalgebras that makes the diagram above commute  As explained previously  we aim to prove the existence of morphism coalgebras by an effective construction  In fact  our arguments rely on a classical proof of the existence of adjoint functors in a category of coalgebras over a comonad  To begin with  we have the following immediate observation  For a cofree coalgebra the required morphism coalgebra is given by the cofree coalgebra  HopfHom L  Gamma V      Gamma  DGHom  overlin eL  V   since we have adjunction relations  Hom   CoAlg a  K otimes overlin eL   overlin e Gamma  V

    Hom   CoAlg a    K  Gamma  DGHom  overlin eL  V      morphism coalgebra of a cofree coalgebra  These adjunction relations are functorial in and but the middle terms are not functors in  Therefore we prove directly that defines a functor on the full subcategory of generated by cofree coalgebras  For this purpose we consider the augmentation morphism of the adjunction of observation obsv CoFreeCoalgebraHom    ev   Gamma    Gamma  DGHom  overlin eL  V   otimes overlin eL  arrow Gamma V   glossar y   An explicit definition of this morphism can be obtained by going through our adjunction relations  We obtain precisely  In the adjunction of observation obsv CoFreeCoalgebraHom  Hom   CoAlg a  K otimes overlin eL   overlin e Gamma  V      Hom   CoAlg a    K  Gamma  DGHom  overlin eL  V     the augmentation morphism can be identified with the coalgebra morphism  ev   Gamma    Gamma  DGHom  overlin eL  V   otimes overlin eL  arrow overlin e Gamma  V  induced by the composite morphism of dg-modules  Gamma  DGHom  overlin eL  V   otimes overlin eL  arrow DGHom  overlin eL  V  otimes overlin eL   xrightarro w ev V  where we consider the universal morphism of the cofree coalgebra  Gamma  DGHom  overlin eL  V   arrow DGHom  overlin eL  V   and the augmentation morphism  ev   DGHom  overlin eL  V  otimes overlin eL  arrow V glossar y   of the adjunction relation  Hom   g Mod  K otimes overlin eL  V     Hom   g Mod  K  DGHom  overlin eL  V   in the category of dg-modules  Then let  ev  Gamma  sharp   Gamma  DGHom  overlin eL  V   arrow DGHom  overlin eL   overlin e Gamma  V    denote the adjoint morphism of in the category of dg-modules  We obtain  We suppose given a morphism of cofree coalgebras induced by a morphism of dg-modules so that preserves the unit of the cofree coalgebra  We consider the morphism of cofree coalgebras  nabla  f   ev  Gamma  sharp    Gamma  DGHom  overlin eL  V   arrow Gamma  DGHom  overlin eL  W    induced by the composite  Gamma  DGHom  overlin eL  V   xrightarro w ev  Gamma  sharp  DGHom  overlin eL   overlin e Gamma  V    xrightarro wf    DGHom  overlin eL  W   We claim that this morphism fits a commutative diagram  xymatri x  Hom   CoAlg a  K otimes overlin eL   overlin e Gamma  V   ar d     nabla f     ar r   0 45     	  Hom   CoAlg a    K  Gamma  DGHom  overlin eL  V    ar d     nabla  f   ev  Gamma  sharp

  hookrightarrow DGHom  overlin eL  V   This assertion arises as a straightforward consequence of our constructions  To conclude this set of observations  we can form an enriched category of augmented unitary coalgebras in which morphism objects are given by the morphism coalgebras  The bijection yields an embedding from the ground category to the enriched category of augmented unitary coalgebras  The morphism coalgebra extends clearly to a bifunctor on this enriched category  Observe also that for a group-like element equivalent to a morphism the composition process of observation obsv CoalgebraComposition extends the definition of claim claim CoFreeCoalgebraHom   medskip We claim that our construction permits to obtain an explicit realization of the morphism coalgebra for a quasi-cofree coalgebra  We obtain precisely the following result   morphism coalgebra of a quasi-cofree coalgebra  If is a quasi-cofree coalgebra  then so is the morphism coalgebra  To be more explicit  suppose given a quasi-cofree unitary coalgebra where the coderivation is induced by a homogeneous map  Then we have   HopfHom L M      Gamma  DGHom  overlin eL  V    tial   alpha   ev  Gamma  sharp    where the coderivation is induced by the composite map  Gamma  DGHom  overlin eL  V   xrightarro w ev  Gamma  sharp  DGHom  overlin eL   overlin e Gamma  V    xrightarro w alpha    DGHom  overlin eL  V   Furthermore  the adjunction augmentation  ev   HopfHom L M  otimes overlin eL  arrow overlin eM  can be identified with a coalgebra morphism  ev  Gamma    Gamma  DGHom  overlin eL  V    tial   alpha   ev  Gamma  sharp   otimes overlin eL  arrow  overlin e Gamma  V   tial  alpha  supplied by observation obsv CoFreeCoalgebraEvaluation  Roughly  we check that the equations of lemma lemm QuasiCofreeCoalgebraStructure involved in quasi-cofree coalgebra structures hold for the pair and that the adjunction relation of observation obsv CoFreeCoalgebraHom extends to quasi-cofree coalgebras  Basically  our results are consequences of the following commutation relation between the coderivations and the adjunction augmentation  The coderivation makes the diagram  xymatri x Gamma  DGHom  overline L  V   otimes overlin eL  ar r   0 7   ev  Gamma   ar d    tial   alpha   ev  Gamma  sharp  otimes overlin eL   	  overlin e Gamma  V  ar d    tial   alpha  
  Gamma  DGHom  overlin eL  V   otimes overlin eL  ar r   0 7   ev  Gamma  	  overlin e Gamma  V    commute  In the diagram both composites define coderivations where  One can extend the correspondence of lemma lemm QuasiCofreeCoalgebraStructure to this relative context  Hence these coderivations agree if and only if their composite with the universal morphism agree  Thus  as in the proof of claim claim CoFreeCoalgebraHom it suffices to compare the composite  Gamma  DGHom  overlin eL  V   otimes overlin eL   xrightarro w tial   alpha   ev  Gamma  sharp  otimes overlin eL   Gamma  DGHom  overlin eL  V   otimes overlin eL   xrightarro w ev  Gamma  overlin e Gamma  V  xrightarro w pi V with  The identity of these morphisms follows also from formal verifications  As a corollary  we obtain  The relation implies the same relation for the coderivation  Hence the pair   Gamma  DGHom  overlin eL  V    tial   alpha   ev  Gamma  sharp   defines a quasi-cofree coalgebra  By adjunction  we deduce from claim claim AdjunctionAugmentationCoderivation that the diagram  xymatri x Gamma  DGHom  overline L  V   ar r    ev  Gamma  sharp  ar d    tial   alpha   ev  Gamma  sharp   	  DGHom  overlin eL   Gamma V   ar d    tial   alpha

Connected coalgebras
 First  recall that a unitary coalgebra is connected  connected coalgebra  if the iterated coproduct of the associated non-unitary coalgebra vanishes for sufficiently large  The full subcategory of formed by connected coalgebras is denoted by  glossar y    This category is equipped with cofree object like  One observes precisely that the cofree object cogenerated by in is realized by the tensor coalgebra  glossar y   defined by the direct sum T c V    oplus  n 0    infty  V   otimes n  and equipped with the diagonal induced by the deconcatenation of tensors  In fact  we have clearly an adjunction relation  Hom   g Mod   overlin eL  V     Hom   CoAlg a 0  L T c V    for any connected coalgebra  The unit cokernel of the tensor coalgebra is also denoted by  glossar y     medskip Our results on the morphism coalgebra associated to connected coalgebras and are consequences of the following observation  If is a connected coalgebra  then the iterated coproduct vanishes for large  for any coalgebra  Accordingly  the tensor product forms also a connected  but non-augmented  coalgebra  Accordingly  for a connected coalgebra The map defines a functor from the category of augmented coalgebras to the category of connected coalgebras  We have clearly   morphism coalgebra of a connected coalgebra   connected coalgebra morphism coalgebra of a  The restriction of the functor to connected coalgebras defines a right adjoint of the functor considered above  On the other hand  one can deduce from observation obsv ConnectedProduct that the relations of observation obsv CoFreeCoalgebraHom hold for a connected cofree coalgebra  Explicitly  we have the following assertion   morphism coalgebra of a tensor coalgebra   tensor coalgebra morphism coalgebra of a  If is a connected coalgebra  then we have adjunction relations  Hom   CoAlg a  K otimes overlin eL   overlin eT  c V

Fibration properties
 One can deduce from formal properties of monoidal model categories that a Hopf endomorphism operad is a Reedy fibrant object if is a fibrant unitary dg-coalgebras  One can extend this assertion to connected unitary coalgebras because the adjoint definition of morphism coalgebras holds in the connected context as well by fact fact ConnectedCoalgebraAdjunction  As any quasi-cofree connected coalgebra forms a fibrant object in the category of connected coalgebras  we obtain that the Hopf endomorphism operad of the bar complex is Reedy fibrant  In the next paragraphs  we give another more effective proof of this assertion in order to extend our results to the Hopf operad of bar operations  Explicitly  as mentioned in the introduction of section CocellularCoalgebras we prove that the augmentation morphism of the Hopf endomorphism operad splits up into a sequence  HopfEnd  B A      lim m ckcell m HopfEnd  B A   arrow ots

On -module structures and the canonical filtration of the bar complex
 Recall that the -module structure of a Hopf endomorphism operad is deduced from operations on the source  To be more precise  one can observe that the tensor powers of a unitary coalgebra form a left Hopf -module  The symmetric group operates on by tensor permutations and we have operations given by the insertion of a coalgebra unit at the th place  The induced operations and determine the -module structure of  The quotient Hopf -modules are associated to a sequence of Hopf -submodules of  Explicitly  for we let denote the submodule of such that   skcell m B A    otimes r     oplus  m q m 1  ots m r q 0   Sigma A   otimes m 1  ots m r   Recall that is equipped with coderivations denoted by and given by the bar coderivation of the th factor of for  Clearly  the submodule is preserved by the bar coderivations and hence form a dg-submodule of  In fact  we have more precisely  We have  By definition  the bar coderivation maps the module into components such that  Hence the assertion is immediate  Then  as expected  we have clearly  The dg-modules  skcell m B A    otimes r   subset B A    otimes r  are preserved by the diagonal and by the differential of by the action of the symmetric group and by the operations  Hence these dg-modules define a nested sequence of Hopf -submodules of such that B A    otimes r     colim m skcell m B A    otimes r    As a corollary we obtain  The coalgebras  ckcell m HopfEnd  B A   r     HopfHom  skcell m B A    otimes r  B A   define a tower of quotient Hopf -modules of such that  HopfEnd  B A      mylim m ckcell m HopfEnd  B A    Furthermore  we have  ckcell m HopfEnd  B A       Gamma  ckcell m PrimEnd  B A     tial   where denotes the quotient -module of defined by  ckcell m PrimEnd  B A   r     prod  m q m 1  ots m r>0  DGHom  Sigma A   otimes m 1  ots m r   Sigma A   Observe that forms also a unital unitary quotient Hopf -module of  Explicitly  we have clearly  Furthermore  the collection   Id   otimes n   in prod n DGHom  Sigma A  Sigma A    otimes n  that represents the unit element of specifies clearly a unit element in for all and projects tautologically to the unit element of the commutative operad for   medskip Clearly  the Hopf -module  HopfEnd B   P  r     HopfHom  A in P Alg  B A    otimes r  B A   is equipped with a similar decomposition induced by the decomposition of  Explicitly  we have for unital unitary Hopf -modules such that   ckcell m HopfEnd B   P  r     HopfHom  A in P Alg   skcell m B A    otimes r  B A    Furthermore  we have  ckcell m HopfEnd B   P      Gamma  ckcell m PrimEnd B   P    tial   for unitary quotient -modules of that can be defined by  ckcell m PrimEnd  B A   r     prod  m q m 1  ots m r>0  DGHom  A in P Alg   Sigma A   otimes m 1  ots m r   Sigma A    medskip We check that the requirements of item CofreeLambdaModuleCoextensions are satisfied for the Hopf -modules so that the morphisms  pk m    Gamma  ckcell  m  PrimEnd  B A     tial  arrow  Gamma  ckcell  m-1  PrimEnd  B A     tial  have the structure specified in subsection CocellularHopfLambdaModules and similarly for the functorial Hopf endomorphism operad  First  for we have explicitly  Let  The homogeneous maps that determine the coderivations of admit factorizations  xymatri x  Gamma K  ar d  ar r    beta  	  Pi ar d

Prospects  actions of cellular operads
 Thinking about it  in our construction  we consider a natural cocellular decomposition of the Hopf operad of universal bar operations which arises from the degreewise filtration of the bar complex  In subsequent work  we plan to study operadic cellular structures giving rise to refinements of this cocellular decomposition  As alluded to in the memoir introduction  this might shed light on the algebraic structure of the bar complex for subclasses of particular algebras  This prospect motivates in part our presentation choices and the detailed accounts of subsection BarHopfEndomorphismOperad -subsection FibrationProperties

The explicit equations of Hopf operad actions

Introduction
 In this section we address the issue of constructing effectively Hopf operad actions on the bar construction  In fact  our results can supply explicit recursive constructions for the operations associated to operad elements  Our purpose is to give this elementary construction either as an illustration of our techniques or for a direct application   medskip To be explicit  we consider again the universal Hopf endomorphism operad defined in subsection BarHopfEndomorphismOperad the operad of universal bar operations defined in subsection BarHopfOperations and the canonical morphism  According to theorem thm BarHopfEndomorphismOperadRecall the action of a unital Hopf operad on the bar complex is equivalent to a morphism  In subsection BarHopfOperations we observe that the natural morphism is an isomorphism  Consequently  For a -projective operad any morphism is equivalent to a composite  xymatrix C 3m m  Q ar rr   0 4   nabla  heta  ar  -->    DR  dr   0 35   nabla  rho  	   HopfEnd B   P

The expansion of operations on the bar complex
 As stated in the section introduction  the goal of this subsection is to make explicit the equations satisfied by maps in order to obtain an elementary and effective characterization of the action of a unital Hopf operad on the bar construction  This result is obtained as a consequence of constructions of the previous section  Namely such a collection of maps is associated to coalgebra morphisms that specify an operad action on the bar complex if and only if they define a morphism of unital Hopf operad  Therefore we relate simply the equations of an operad morphism to equivalent properties for the maps  For this aim we recall briefly the definition of the Hopf operad of universal bar operations
Recalls  the coalgebra structure of the universal Hopf operads
 Precisely  recall that the Hopf endomorphism operad respectively the Hopf operad of universal bar operations is defined by quasi-cofree coalgebras such that 	  HopfEnd B   P  r      Gamma  PrimEnd B   P  r    tial

Lifting process and effective constructions
 According to results of subsection FibrationProperties for an -operad a morphism that supplies effectively an operad action on the bar complex  can be obtained by lifting the morphism associated to the classical shuffle product for the bar complex of commutative algebras  Explicitly  a morphism is defined by a solution of the lifting problem  xymatri x 	   HopfOp B   E  ar  ->>  d    sim
