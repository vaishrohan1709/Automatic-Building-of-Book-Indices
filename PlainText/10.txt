Introduction
 On the one hand  the general theory of quantum groups has its roots in approaches in the axiomatizations of generalizations of groups such that the Pontryagin-van Kampen duality for locally compact abelian groups extends to this wider class  On the other hand  a large class of explicit and interesting quantum groups arose from various cases  e g  -matrices as solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation and the RTF-formalism  For the quantum groups related to compact groups arising in this way the duality is formulated on the level of Hopf algebra duality between the quantized function algebra and the quantized enveloping algebra  For the historic development of the general theory for locally compact quantum groups we refer to the papers --especially the introductions-- Kust KustVASENS MasuNW and books EnocS Timm  For the development of quantum groups involving the Yang-Baxter equation and the RTF-formalism we refer to the books CharP EtinS Kass  It has turned out that many of the examples arising in this way fit into the general theory of quantum groups  especially for the quantum group analogues of compact groups  These quantum groups can usually be analyzed in an algebraic way  For quantum group analogues of non-compact groups the situation is not so clear  As it turns out the Hopf algebra arising from the standard -matrix for has three different -structures MasuMNNSU and we consider a -structure making the Hopf algebra into a Hopf -algebra as the choice of an appropriate real form  The compact case  corresponding to the quantum group analogue of has been studied extensively  see CharP EtinS Kass and references given there  This is also the basic example of a quantum group having an intimate link with special functions of basic hypergeometric type GaspR see CharP EtinS Kass SchmK as well as KoelAAM  Then there is the non-compact case associated to the non-compact group and a non-compact case associated to the group  Although as Lie groups the corresponding Hopf -algebras for the deformed case are different  The subject of this paper is the Hopf -algebra associated to the group in which the deformation parameter is real  For the case of the Hopf -algebra associated to the deformation parameter is on the unit circle  and the situation changes dramatically  see CharP and for recent progress on the level of associated special functions see van de Bult vdBult  In this paper we focus on the Hopf -algebra associated to which is recalled in Section sec quantumSU11description  We also recall that Woronowicz WoroCMP91 showed that there was no way to extend the comultiplication of this Hopf -algebra in analytic way  i e  to the level of operators on Hilbert spaces  Based on work of Korogodsky Koro and Woronowicz Woropp it is possible to show that there exists a quantum group analogue of the normalizer of in in the context of the definition of Kustermans and Vaes KustVASENS KustVMS  see also Kust and VanDpp for an introduction  on the level of a von Neumann algebraic quantum group  This has been shown in KoelKCMP where special functions of basic hypergeometric type proved to be essential in the construction  The purpose of this paper is to give an explicit description of the dual quantum group and to decompose the left regular corepresentation into irreducible corepresentations for this explicit quantum group  In the decomposition of the left regular corepresentation we see the analogy with the group case  since in the left regular representation of the group only discrete series representations and principal unitary series occur  However  in the quantum group case the discrete series are no longer split up into a positive discrete series and a negative discrete series  Some of these results have been announced in KoelK-LN and in this paper we give full proofs of these statements  This paper can be read independently from KoelK-LN  After browsing the paper it should be clear to the casual reader that making the general quantum group machinery work for this specific case is a very technical business  However  we believe that this is worthwhile since is one of the most important non-compact Lie groups vDijk HoweT Knap KoorEM Lang Sugi and any reasonable quantum group theory has to have the example of a quantum group analogue of  Moreover  we hope that understanding this example may also lead to other non-trivial examples of non-compact quantum groups and related quantum homogeneous spaces  such as quantum group analogues of and related homogeneous spaces  Moreover  in the operator algebra context -theory is available  and the first step in this direction is taken Diep  In particular  one can ask for a -theoretic approach to discrete series representations in this setting  We expect that the link with special functions can lead to new and deep results in the theory of special functions  and we have included some highly non-trivial examples in Section sec BHSresults but we expect that the relation is deeper and not yet fully exploited  E g  the link with twisted primitive elements  suitable Cartan type decompositions and  associated  spherical functions and corresponding transform as indicated in KoelSRIMS can be studied from an operator algebraic point of view  see also for a more general study of the Plancherel measure in this context  Having the decomposition of the left regular representation available it is now also natural to consider other questions  e g  can we decompose tensor products  describe the intertwiners in terms of special functions  etc  We are confident that the interpretation of discrete series representations in this context gives a solution to indeterminacy problems related to certain tensor product decompositions of infinite dimensional representations of see cf  GroeAAM GroeRJ for cases where the indeterminacy is absent  We now describe the contents of the paper  In Sections sec vNalgquantumgroups -sec quantumSU11description we recall the necessary background on general locally compact quantum groups in the von Neumann algebraic setting and the specific example that we study  In Section sec vNalgquantumgroups we recall the Kustermans-Vaes approach to locally compact quantum groups on the von Neumann algebraic level  which is the framework for this paper  and Section sec vNalgquantumgroups is mainly based on KustVMS  Next in Section sec quantumSU11description we give a concise description of the Hopf -algebra and the quantum group analogue of the normalizer of in in the context of Section sec vNalgquantumgroups  Section sec quantumSU11description is based on KoelKCMP  In Section sec VonNeumanAlgDualQuantumGroup we give an explicit description of the dual quantum group in the case of the quantum group analogue of the normalizer of in  In particular we show that the generators of the quantized universal enveloping algebra can be realized as unbounded operators affiliated to the von Neumann algebra of the dual quantum group  We discuss how the  suitable extension of the  Casimir operator can be used to find sufficiently many generators  It turns out that the self-adjoint extension of the algebraically defined symmetric  but not essentially self-adjoint  operator is characterized by affiliation to the von Neumann algebra for the dual quantum group  We also show that comultiplication defined on the von Neumann algebraic group coincides with the comultiplication of the Hopf -algebra  In Section sec decompleftregularcorep the decomposition of the left regular corepresentation is presented  it involves analogues of the principal unitary series representations and discrete series representations  In Section sec BHSresults we collect some interesting new  as far as we are aware  results for special functions of basic hypergeometric type which are byproducts of the approach taken  In particular  the results discussed in Section sec BHSresults can be read independently by someone only interested in special functions  but the proofs are dependent on the rest of the paper  Sections sec VonNeumanAlgDualQuantumGroup --sec BHSresults describe the results of this paper in detail and form the core of the paper  All the main results and its background can be obtained from Sections sec vNalgquantumgroups --sec BHSresults  The gist of the main results are obtained when reading only this part of the paper  which can also be viewed as a very extended introduction  The proofs of all statements in these sections are given in the remainder of the paper consisting of Sections sec extensionsgeneratorssu --sec specialfunctions  In Appendix app notationterminology we recall some notation and terminology of von Neumann algebras  whereas we

Von Neumann algebraic quantum groups
 In this section we recall the definition of the von Neumann algebraic quantum groups and related results  So we work with a theory on the quantum group analogue of locally compact groups in the realm of operator algebras  We summarize the main features  and we discuss the group case for a unimodular Lie group  The proofs of all statements can be found in the papers KustVASENS KustVMS by Kustermans and Vaes  Introductory texts on this subject are Kust VanDpp see also Timm  In Section sec quantumSU11description we describe the example we study  namely the von Neumann algebraic quantum group associated to the normalizer of in which is essentially recalling the results of KoelKCMP  Consider a von Neumann algebra together with a unital normal -ho -mo -mor -phism  the comultiplication   comultiplication  such that  coassociativity   Moreover  if there exist two normal semi-finite faithful weights on such that     vp l   om ot Id  De x  r 	        vp x  om 1    qquad  forall    om in M         forall  x in  cM    vp  qquad  left invariance

The quantum group analogue of the normalizer of in
 In this section we recall the von Neumann algebraic quantum group for which we calculate the dual von Neumann algebraic quantum group  and for which we decompose the left regular corepresentation  Except for the last paragraph  all the results described are taken from KoelKCMP  The Lie group is one of the most important non-compact Lie groups  On the level of Hopf algebras  a classification of real forms of the quantized universal enveloping algebra results in three different real forms  i e  Hopf -algebras  the compact case for which is extensively studied CharP EtinS Kass Lusz   the non-compact case with on the unit circle  see e g  the previously mentioned books and vdBult   and the non-compact case for  In these cases there is a related dual Hopf -algebra which is a deformation of the algebra of polynomials on the related group  We refer to the books CharP EtinS Kass Lusz as well as to BurbK MasuMNNSU KoelSRIMS for more information and references  However  as Woronowicz WoroCMP91 proved  there is no C -algebra interpretation for the related Hopf -algebra with a well-defined comultiplication  Later  Korogodsky Koro indicates how the ill-defined comultiplication could be avoided  With the introduction of the theory of von Neumann algebraic quantum KustVASENS KustVMS it is natural to ask whether or not this important example can be incorporated in the theory of von Neumann algebraic quantum groups  As it turns out the answer is yes  and the key to the solution is using special functions  All statements of this section are proved in KoelKCMP except  eqre feq expressionhatJonfmpt  for which a direct proof is given  Throughout the paper  we fix a number  Define  A    to be the unital -algebra generated by elements and and relations where denotes the -operation on  in order to distinguish this kind of adjoint with the adjoints of possibly unbounded operators in Hilbert spaces   In case we take in  eqre feq generatorsrelations  we obtain the -algebra which is usually associated with the algebra of polynomials on the quantum analogue of see MasuMNNSU KoroV KoelSRIMS  The additional generator has been introduced by Korogodsky Koro  For completeness we give the Hopf -algebra  Hopf -algebra   structure on  By we denote the algebraic tensor product  There exists a unique unital -homomorphism such that The counit and antipode are given by This makes into a Hopf -algebra  To see that for we obtain the Hopf -algebra of polynomials on the group  when restricting to the sub-Hopf -algebra given by  and on the normalizer of in we recall    SU 1 1      g  g in SL 2  C   mid g  ast J g   J   1 	 0

Hilbert space resp  representing the relations  there exist no closed operators acting on representing the relations and extending such that extend  Theorem thm Woronowicznogothm is a negative result  but Korogodsky Koro pointed out how to proceed by adding the additional generator  It is not hard to represent the commutation relations  eqre feq generatorsrelations  by unbounded operators acting on the Hilbert space where  I    and equipped with the counting measure  Here  T    denotes the unit circle   N    and  N     If we define for all so the family is the natural orthonormal basis of  For

operators are closable with densely defined closed unbounded operators as their closure  Moreover  the adjoints and are the closures of  Let be the closure of then is a bounded linear self-adjoint operator on  As discussed by Woronowicz Woropp and in KoelKCMP it is not sufficient to consider the von Neumann algebra generated by and in order to obtain a well-defined comultiplication  Consider the linear map where we take in case and let be its partial isometry  is the von Neumann algebra in generated by and  By definition  see Appendix ssecA affiliationandgenerators and are affiliated to  It can be shown that  We define the operators  Phi m p t   colon  zeta r otimes e x  mapsto e  xt      zeta  m r  otimes e p   qquad m r in  Z     p t x in I q  A straightforward calculation gives

-subalgebra in  In order to show that is the von Neumann algebra of a von Neumann algebraic quantum group we need to define the comultiplication and the left and right invariant nsf weights and such that the requirements of Definition def vNalgquantumgroup are met  We start with the construction of the left invariant nsf weight by writing down its GNS-construction  Define on where and are the canonical traces on i e  with normalization and on normalized by for any rank one orthogonal projection  Note that is a tracial weight on so in particular its modular group is trivial  For we have the following GNS-construction  em a Hilbert space  K    equipped with the orthonormal basis    F    em a unital -homomorphism for   em  We define the left invariant nsf weight formally as with the operator affiliated to  We proceed by defining the set as the set of elements of such that extends to a bounded operator on denoted by and such that and for we put  The set is then a core for the operator which is closable for the -strong- --norm topology  The nsf weight on is defined by its GNS-construction  From the general theory of nsf weights as recalled in Section sec vNalgquantumgroups

properties of these functions  Then the comultiplication is given by  recall Remark rmk identifyMinGNSspacevp that we view In fact  this formula has led to the definition of the multiplicative unitary in  eqre feq Wexplicitinapxy   since the functions are interpreted as Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for the tensor product decomposition of the representations considered in  eqre feq formalrepsal0ga0   We refer to for a more elaborate discussion of this motivation  The pair is a von Neumann algebraic quantum group  Theorem thm vNalgqgroupforSU11 is and the really hard part is to prove the coassociativity  For this part the choice of sign in Definition def functionap of the function is essential  It should be noted that the results are obtained in different order in KoelKCMP than presented here  All of the above is included in KoelKCMP but we additionally need the action of the dual modular conjugation  dual modular conjugation   J    in the GNS-space  Explicitly  we have This can be proved from the results in KoelKCMP as follows  Since the right invariant weight equals the left invariant weight  we have for see  Using for the explicit expression of the unitary antipode we

The von Neumann algebra for the dual quantum group
 The general theory as described in Section sec vNalgquantumgroups shows that there is a dual von Neumann algebraic quantum group associated to the von Neumann algebraic quantum group associated to the normalizer of in see Theorem thm duallocallycompactquantumgroup  Since we have the von Neumann algebra explicitly given by Definition def vNalgMinBH and Theorem thm vNalgqgroupforSU11 it is natural to ask for an explicit description in terms of generators for the von Neumann algebra of the dual von Neumann algebraic quantum group  On the level of Hopf algebras  there is a duality between and the quantized universal enveloping algebra see MasuMNNSU and CharP  So it is natural to expect that the quantized enveloping algebra plays a role in an explicit description of but also that will not suffice to describe  This is made explicit in Theorem thm generatorsforhatM  Let us first recall the quantized universal enveloping algebra  quantized universal enveloping algebra   in order to fix the notation  The study of goes back to Vaksman and Korogodski u i  VaksK and Masuda et al  MasuMNNSU see also Burban and Klimyk BurbK  Its representation theory is also needed in this paper  and we recall the irreducible admissible representations in Section sec Casimiroperator where we decompose the GNS-space with respect to the -action  For general information on quantized universal enveloping algebras one can consult e g  CharP EtinS Kass Lusz SchmK  Recall that  U    is the complex unital -algebra generated by and subject to and where the -structure is defined by  Since we assume the -structure is easily seen to be compatible with  eqre feq defrelUqsu11    We identify of KoelSRIMS by and compared to the notation of MasuMNNSU we have and   The algebra has more structure  since it can be made into a Hopf -algebra  For completeness we recall the action of the antipode and the comultiplication on the generators  and The Casimir element is a central self-adjoint element in  In fact  we use a slightly renormalized version of the operator used in MasuMNNSU  If denotes the element introduced in one has  The Casimir element generates the center of  In order to represent the algebra on the Hilbert space of the GNS-re -pre -sen -tation some care has to be taken  since the operators are in general unbounded  We define the dense subspace of as the linear subspace consisting of finite linear combinations of the orthonormal basis elements see the definition in Section sec quantumSU11description  Equivalently can also be viewed as the linear span of elements of the form with where is the space of compactly supported function on  Note that is dense in and that inherits the inner product of so we can look at the space of adjointable operators for see  Recall

easily checks that and that is invertible in  Also and for all  At this point we observe that modular conjugation preserves since see Remark rmk propertiessiJnabla and it follows straightforwardly

explicitly  Indeed  Proposition prop decompMintoM andM-andgradedcommutation implies that elements of can be described by mapping  generalized  eigenvectors for the eigenvalue of the Casimir operator to  generalized  eigenvectors for the eigenvalue of the Casimir operator  For this we have to study the Casimir operator restricted to suitable invariant subspaces on which the spectrum of has simple

The decomposition of the left regular corepresentation
 As remarked in Section sec vNalgquantumgroups the multiplicative unitary acting in the GNS-representation of the left invariant weight is the analogue of the left regular representation  For the Lie group the decomposition into irreducible representations involves the principal unitary series and the discrete series  see e g  vDijk HoweT KoorEM Lang Sugi  The decomposition is obtained by considering the action of the Casimir operator  since its eigenspaces give invariant subspaces as the Casimir operator is a central element  Our next goal is to decompose the left regular corepresentation given by the multiplicative unitary acting in the GNS-representation into irreducible corepresentations  We want to proceed in a similar fashion  but as follows from Proposition prop decompMintoM andM-andgradedcommutation we need to combine two eigenspaces of the Casimir operator  We first consider the discrete part  and next the continuous part  In Section sec Casimiroperator we decompose the GNS-space into irreducible representations for by decomposing the action of the Casimir operator  and since its generators are related to affiliated operators to we expect that this is a building block in the decomposition  In this section we describe the decomposition explicitly  and for each corepresentation in the decomposition of the left regular corepresentation we indicate its decomposition as -representation using its representations as described in Section ssec decompUq su11   In order to find the decomposition of the left regular corepresentation we have to look for invariant subspaces of which are the generators of  By Proposition prop decompMintoM andM-andgradedcommutation we can restrict to eigenspaces for the Casimir operator for the eigenvalues and  By considering combinations of such eigenspaces in suitable invariant subspaces for the Casimir operator we can determine invariant subspaces  hence irreducible corepresentations occurring in the decomposition of the left regular corepresentation  In this approach we have to distinguish between eigenvalues of the Casimir operator satisfying leading to the analogue of discrete series representations of and those satisfying leading to the analogue of principal unitary series representations of  The case has to be considered separately  In Section ssec discreterepsinregularrep we discuss the analogue of the discrete series representations  and in Section ssec principalrepsinregularrep we discuss the analogue of the principal unitary series representations  For the precise description of the results we need to use some notation that is used in the proofs 
Unitary corepresentations  discrete series
  corepresentation discrete series  In order to be able to describe the results we need to consider the discrete spectrum of the Casimir operator  The complete spectrum of the Casimir operator is described in Section sec Casimiroperator where for suitable -invariant subspaces the spectral decomposition of is discussed in detail  The spectrum is simple and consists of a continuous part and a discrete part depending on for  We refer to  eqre feq defKpmepeta  for the definition of these subspaces  Throughout this subsection we fix and set  Thus  is an isolated point of the spectrum of the Casimir operator if see Section ssec spectraldecompCasimir  We denote to be the eigenvector of the Casimir operator for the eigenvalue in the subspace of the GNS-space  We note that if and only if has an eigenvector with eigenvalue inside  By the results proved in Section ssec spectraldecompCasimir the eigenspace of restricted to is at most one-dimensional  so that is defined up to phase-factor after putting  The precise choice is given in Section ssec discreteseries  Recall we have to find closed invariant subspaces for the action of and we can define closed invariant subspaces in terms of the eigenvectors of the Casimir operator  This is straightforward once we have described the actions of the generators of on the eigenvectors of in Lemma lem actionsofgeneratorsoneigvetsOm  We define the closed subspace of as The space is an invariant subspace of the corepresentation of  If we say that that determines a discrete series corepresentation of  The element is a unitary corepresentation of on  Using the explicit actions of the generators of as described in Theorem thm generatorsforhatM on the eigenvectors of the Casimir operator we can classify the values of such that is a discrete series corepresentation of  The result is the following  Consider and where and  Let be such that so  Then determines a discrete series corepresentation of in the following 3 cases  and these are the only cases  em      i   If in which case is an orthonormal basis for  em      ii   If and in which case is an orthonormal basis for  em      iii   If and in which case is an orthonormal basis for  Proposition prop discretesubrepresinregrepr gives a complete list of discrete corepresentations occurring in the left regular corepresentation  In each of the cases listed in Proposition prop discretesubrepresinregrepr we can consider the representation of as a representation of  by unbounded operators in the sense of Schm   and then  by comparing the action of and as given in Lemma lem actionsofgeneratorsoneigvetsOm with the listing in Section ssec decompUq su11  we see that in case  i    ii  and  iii  of Proposition prop discretesubrepresinregrepr corresponds to as -module  where the decomposition corresponds to the order of the orthonormal basis  The notation for the -modules is as in Section ssec decompUq su11   Here is defined in Definition defn chikappanuands and  E    so for and for see  eqre feq epsilon p    So we see that a discrete series corepresentation in the left regular corepresentation decomposes in the same way as sum of three -representations involving a strange series representation in combination with a positive and negative discrete series representation  Assume that determines a discrete series corepresentation of  Then is an irreducible corepresentation of

Results for special functions of basic hypergeometric type
 This section is separately readable from the remainder of the paper  This section is meant to give a couple of examples of rather complicated identities for special functions of basic hypergeometric type and type see GaspR  We assume that the reader of this section is familiar with the notation for basic hypergeometric series GaspR but the definition is recalled in Appendix app specialfunctions  In the first subsection we introduce the notation for special functions  and we recall some elementary properties  The first subsection introduces notation and special functions that are used throughout the paper  whereas the following subsections give explicit highly non-trivial results for these special functions  These identities follow from the quantum group theoretic interpretation

Summation and transformation formulas for
 The functions which as noted above are closely related to some well-known orthogonal polynomials of basic hypergeometric type  are used in the definition of the so-called multiplicative unitary see  eqre feq Wexplicitinapxy   In the general theory of locally compact groups  the multiplicative unitary plays an important role  In particular  it satisfies the pentagonal equation  a relation that is essential in proving Propositions prop structureconstQs and prop hatDeonQppn  The result in these propositions lead to operator identities in suitable Hilbert spaces  and taking matrix coefficients then essentially lead to Theorems thm symmetryforsinglesumfourapxys and thm doublesumfiveapxysequalsthreeapxys in this section  The details of the proofs are given in Section ssec summationformula

The comultiplication on
 In order to calculate the action of the comultiplication of the dual quantum group on the elements we note that this can be done in greater generality  First observe The first equality is straightforward  and the second follows from the pentagonal equation for the multiplicative unitary  see Section sec vNalgquantumgroups  Using an orthonormal basis for the Hilbert space so that we have we get using the definition of and notation as in Theorem thm duallocallycompactquantumgroup   Proof of Proposition prop hatDeonQppn   We use the general formula  eqre feq generalobsforcomultiplication-2  with the orthonormal basis  and next  eqre feq generalcasereducestoQppn  to rewrite the right hand side in terms of the operators  The series converges in the von Neumann algebra so that we find convergence in the -weak topology  Next we prove the link between the comultiplication of the dual quantum group and the comultiplication  eqre feq Hopfalgebracomultiplication  of the Hopf -algebra as given in Proposition prop dualcomultiplicationandcomultiplicationsu   Proof of Proposition prop dualcomultiplicationandcomultiplicationsu   The comultiplication for the dual locally compact quantum group is given by see Theorem thm duallocallycompactquantumgroup  We use the same formula for the elements and affiliated to see Proposition prop KEaffiliatedtohatM  In order to prove that we need to show or  So it suffices to check that  Now by  eqre feq Wexplicitinapxy  and  eqre feq defKanddomain  we check this formula first by evaluating it on the orthonormal basis of  So for arbitrary    	 qquad   ngle W    f  m 1 p 1 t 1   ot f  m 1  p 1  t 1     K  ot 1  f  m 2 p 2 t 2   ot f  m 2  p 2  t 2     rangle           sqr t| frac p 2  t 2 |   q  - hf m 2

Graded commutation relations for the Casimir operator
 This subsection is devoted to the proof of Proposition prop decompMintoM andM-andgradedcommutation  The first statement of this proposition is an immediate consequence of Proposition prop QppngeneratedualM which we already proved in Section ssec commutantofdualvNalg  Recall the subspaces defined in Definition def defKpmandMpm  Note that Proposition prop QppngeneratedualM implies that is the strong- closure of Next we investigate the graded commutation relations of the Casimir operator with the elements generating the von Neumann algebra see Lemma lem QppnareallinhatM as stated in Proposition prop decompMintoM andM-andgradedcommutation  The hard computations are contained in the following lemma  whose proof is postponed to Appendix app proofofcommutionQwithCasimir  For and we have    ngle Q p 1 p 2 n    u   Om 0   v rangle    sgn p 1p 2    ngle Q p 1 p 2 n    Om 0   u  v rangle     Let and then and  Consider  From Lemma lem sgncommutationQppnwithCasimir0 it follows that the vector belongs to and     Om 0     v         sgn p 1p 2    Q p 1 p 2 n     Om 0   f  m p t      By Lemma lem explicitactionQppn the vector and if there exists by Lemma lem behaviourhatJQppnhatJincase   a function that is differentiable in and satisfies for all  From Lemma lem vinD Om  we now conclude that and that hence     sgn p 1p 2    Q p 1 p 2 n     Om 0    subset    Om   Q p 1 p 2 n      Now for and the lemma follows from the closedness of and  eqre feq hatM -closureof  We need to improve the commutation relations from Lemma lem xOm0subset -Omx to come to the second statement of Proposition prop decompMintoM andM-andgradedcommutation  To do this we need the following lemma  Consider a Hilbert space a self-adjoint operator in and a partial isometry on for which the final projection commutes with  Then is self-adjoint  First we show that is densely defined  Set and  Since we have that implying that  Clearly  thus from which it follows that is densely defined  Next we need to verify the self-adjointness  Let then  since is self-adjoint  Thus  is symmetric  To prove that is self-adjoint  choose  If then and  Thus  ngle U v A w  rangle 	   ngle v U   A w  rangle   ngle v U   Q A w  rangle   ngle v  U   A Q w  rangle

Spectral decomposition of the Casimir operator
 From  the proof of  Lemma lem xOm0subset -Omx it follows that maps eigenvectors for eigenvalue of in to multiples of eigenvectors of in for the eigenvalue or to zero  So  it will be convenient to have an alternative description of the GNS-space corresponding to the spectral decomposition of  This alternative description has the advantage that the action of the operators and  of course  is far more transparent  Moreover  it leads to the direct integral decomposition of the left regular corepresentation of into irreducible unitary representations  see Section sec decompleftregularcorep  The description of the spectral decomposition of relies on certain special functions which can be written in terms of basic hypergeometric series  the Al-Salam--Chihara polynomials and the little -Jacobi functions  The main properties of these special functions needed in this subsection are given in Appendices ssecB AlSCpol and ssecB litteqJacobi  The spectral decomposition of the Casimir immediately leads to the decomposition of the GNS-space as a -module  This is done in Section ssec decompUq su11 
 The Casimir operator is a self-adjoint extension of  Let  It follows from  eqre feq actioncasimir  that is basically a Jacobi operator  i e   a tridiagonal operator on or  The spectral decomposition of these specific Jacobi operators can be described in terms of Al-Salam--Chihara polynomials in case of and in terms of little -Jacobi functions in case of  Whether can be identified with or depends on the sign of the parameters and see the beginning of Section ssec decompositionofGNSspace  We need to distinguish between four different cases  Let us recall from  eqre feq JE0JisminE0dag  that the modular conjugation defined by satisfies that and and consequently  Note that since with and  We will use this to reduce the number of cases that we need to consider 
The case and
 Recall that  In the case under consideration     J p m   -    z in I q mid -q mpz in I q    sgn z        can be labeled by using  Now put using this identification  then  eqre feq actioncasimir  leads to Comparing this with the Jacobi operator for the Al-Salam--Chihara polynomials   eqre feq JacobioperAlSCpol   see also  eqre feq recAlSCpol   we see that  By Theorem thm spectraldecompASC and  eqre feq measureASC  extends uniquely to a bounded self-adjoint operator on and it has continuous spectrum and discrete spectrum where using the notation of  eqre feq defIabqforASCpol   The multiplicity of the  generalized  eigenspaces is one  Let see  eqre feq defIabqforASCpol   We define the operator in terms of Al-Salam--Chihara polynomials using the notation as in  eqre feq deffnabqforASCpol   Then gives the spectral decomposition of the action of the Casimir operator on so is a unitary intertwiner of the Casimir operator with the multiplication operator  M    on  Here  and elsewhere  denotes the operator of multiplication by the function  The factor in  eqre feq defUpsilonpm -  is not of importance for the spectral decomposition of the Casimir operator  but is inserted in order to avoid signs later on when we decompose as a -module 
The case and
 Using the modular conjugation the case and can be reduced to the case and  Define using the notation  eqre feq defIabqforASCpol   then gives the intertwiner of the action of the Casimir operator with  As before has a unique extension to a bounded self-adjoint operator with multiplicity one for the  generalized  eigenspaces  Combining Sections sssec caseep andet- and sssec caseep-andet  we see that for we have the following description of the discrete spectrum  
The case and
 In this case the -interval can be labeled by  If we put then we need in order to have  So we have to consider two cases  and  Since the modular conjugation changes the sign of we can restrict to and obtain the other case using  We assume and put so that labels  Put then the expression  eqre feq actioncasimir  for gives which we recognize using  eqre feq JacobioperAlSCpol  and  eqre feq recAlSCpol  as the Jacobi operator for the Al-Salam--Chihara polynomials  So uniquely extends to a bounded self-adjoint operator  Put see  eqre feq defIabqforASCpol   then intertwines the action of the Casimir operator with the multiplication operator on for  Note that we take the normalized Al-Salam--Chihara polynomials with a minus sign in front of the argument because of the minus sign in front of in  eqre feq modCasonKpm--   In case we define and This gives two definitions in case or and it is straightforward to check that they coincide  Now we have the intertwiner for the action of the Casimir operator with the multiplication operator on for all and  Let us remark that the discrete spectrum is given explicitly by In both cases at most one of the two sets is non-empty 
The case and
 In this case can be labeled by  We put and then  eqre feq actioncasimir  gives Comparing this with  eqre feq JacobioperatorreclqJacf  we recognize as the  doubly infinity  Jacobi operator for the little -Jacobi functions  Let us remark that there are other choices for the parameters which  of course  all lead to the same result  we can identify also with or  Because of these symmetries we can obtain the spectral decomposition of a self-adjoint extension of in the case from the case  Let us first assume that  By Theorem thm spectraldecompL the unbounded operator is essentially self-adjoint for so in this case has a unique self-adjoint extension  The spectral decomposition of is described in Theorem thm spectraldecompL  For we choose the self-adjoint extension of with spectral decomposition as described in Theorem thm Jacobioperatorforcasec q  The multiplicity of the  generalized  eigenspaces is one  Put using the notation as in  eqre feq defIabqforlqJacfun   then for intertwines the action of the Casimir operator with the multiplication operator on using the notation  eqre feq orthonorlqJacfun   To this end we need to argue that agrees with which is clear in the case  For we recall from the proof of Lemma lem extensionsofOmega0 that is the self-adjoint extension of described in Theorem thm Jacobioperatorforcasec q as is  Note that we take in  eqre feq defUpsilonpm  mleq0  the normalized little -Jacobi functions with a minus sign in front of the argument because of the minus sign in front of in  eqre feq modCasonKpm     For define and Note that this corresponds to the symmetry of the corresponding Jacobi operator     L q  2-2m  q  1-2m  p -q 2  mid q 2  L q  2 2m  pq  1 2m  -q 2  mid q 2      as we observed earlier  As before  for the operators intertwine the action of the Casimir operator with the multiplication operator on  It may seem that we now have two definitions for but it follows from  eqre feq specialsymmetryjk  that they coincide  Finally  let us give an explicit description of the discrete spectrum   The last two sets are finite and at most one of them is non-empty  while the first set is infinite

The decomposition of the GNS-space as a -module
 The  generalized  eigenspaces of the Casimir operator correspond to invariant subspaces under the action of  In this way  the spectral decomposition of from Section ssec spectraldecompCasimir leads to the decomposition of the GNS-space into irreducible -representations of  Let us first recall these representations of  The -representations of require unbounded operators  and for this we use the theory as developed in  In particular this means that for such a representation in a Hilbert space there exists a common dense domain which is invariant for for all such that the relations of  eqre feq defrelUqsu11  remain valid when acting on  Moreover  we require for all  It follows that each is closable  Admissible representations of are -representations in a Hilbert space acting by unbounded operators  such that decomposes into finite-dimensional eigenspaces for the action of and such that the eigenvalues of are of the form  Then the following irreducible admissible representations exhaust the list  see e g  BurbK MasuMNNSU VaksK  In each of these cases the common invariant dense domain is the subspace of finite linear combinations of the basis vectors  Note that each of these admissible irreducible representations is completely determined by the eigenvalue of the Casimir operator on and the spectrum of  Positive discrete series   U  -representations positive discrete series   quad The representation space is with orthonormal basis  Let define the action of the generators by with the convention  This representation is denoted by  D    and  Negative discrete series   U  -representations negative discrete series   quad The representation space is with orthonormal basis  Let and define the action of the generators by with the convention  This representation is denoted by  D    and  Principal series   U  -representations principal series   quad The representation space is with orthonormal basis  Let and and assume  The action of the generators is defined by We denote the representation by   P    In case this still defines an admissible unitary representation  It splits as the direct sum of a positive and negative discrete series representation by restricting to the invariant subspaces and to  We keep this convention for  Note that  Strange series   U  -representations strange series   quad The representation space is with orthonormal basis  Let and  The action of the generators is defined by We denote this representation by   P    Note that  Complementary series   U  -representations complementary series   quad This series of representations acts in  The actions of the generators follow from the action  eqre feq princunitaryserrep  by putting and formally replacing by and taking  This series of representations does not play a role in this paper   medskip We define  From  eqre feq defrelUqsu11  we check that extends to an involutive algebra homomorphism  From  eqre feq Casimir  it is clear that  Composing an irreducible admissible representation with the involutive algebra automorphism gives an admissible irreducible representation of  This easily gives Denoting the orthonormal bases in the representations on the left hand side of  eqre feq tauopirreps  by we can describe the unitary intertwiners as in the first case and as for the last two cases  Recall that the modular conjugation satisfies that and and consequently  This implies that implements the involutive algebra automorphism  The spectral decomposition of the Casimir operator from Section ssec spectraldecompCasimir gives a decomposition of into invariant subspaces for the action of  Let and  It follows from  eqre feq E0E0dagKoncK0  that the space is invariant for the action of  We denote by  P     U  -representations P    the representation of on   K    In the following we decompose in terms of irreducible admissible -representations of using the spectral decomposition of from Section ssec spectraldecompCasimir  As before  we have to distinguish four cases depending on the signs of and  It turns out that the representation label for the principal and strange series representations occurring in the decomposition of depends on the parameter  For this reason we define by
The case and
 In this case the spectral decomposition of the Casimir operator acting on is determined by  eqre feq defUpsilonpm -   From the explicit action of  eqre feq dualE0forsu    eqre feq defUpsilonpm -  and Lemma lem contiguousASC we obtain Note that unless  In this case and the multiplication operator is zero for the point  So the multiplication operator in  eqre feq actionE0 inUpsilonpm -  is well-defined    From  eqre feq E0E0dagKoncK0  we have so  eqre feq actionE0 inUpsilonpm -  and  eqre feq Casimir  give This can also be derived directly from a similar identity for the Al-Salam--Chihara polynomials  is not an admissible representation of since the -eigenspaces are not finite dimensional  However  since the actions of and in  eqre feq actionE0 inUpsilonpm -    eqre feq actionE0inUpsilonpm -  match the actions given in the list of irreducible -representations for we can still determine the decomposition explicitly  The possible eigenvalues of the Casimir and the eigenvalues of then determine the decomposition  In Theorem thm decompKp -asUqmod we deal with the positive discrete series representations  since for large enough implying that acts as the creation operator  The direct integral and direct sums of representations of by unbounded operators in Theorem thm decompKp -asUqmod uses the construction of  The decomposition of into irreducible admissible -re -pre -sen -ta -tions is given by     pi  cK p   -   cong  int 0  - pi 2 ln q   pi  b  silon p      db  oplus oplus   substack l in Z

The case and
 In Section sssec caseep-andet  we obtained the spectral decomposition of in this case from the case and using the modular conjugation  For the actions of and we can do the same  Using we obtain from  eqre feq actionE0 inUpsilonpm -  and  eqre feq actionE0inUpsilonpm -  This can also be proved in the same way as  eqre feq actionE0 inUpsilonpm -  and  eqre feq actionE0inUpsilonpm -     From and  eqre feq tauopirreps  we obtain from Theorem thm decompKp -asUqmod the following decomposition of as -module  Let  The decomposition of into irreducible admissible -representations is given by     pi  cK p -     cong  int 0  - pi 2 ln q   pi  b  silon p      db  oplus oplus   substack l in Z

 2l  chi p <-1    pi S  pq  1 2l   silon p      
The case and
 Similar as in the case and we find In the first equation we assume and in the second we require  It is now a matter of bookkeeping to keep track of the discrete spectrum of in in order to find the discrete summands in the decomposition of as -module  Note that for there is always discrete spectrum for large  so that acts as the creation operator and hence we have positive discrete series representations in the decomposition  Similarly  leads to the occurrence of negative discrete series representations in the decomposition  The decomposition of into irreducible admissible representations is given by     pi  cK p - -   cong  int 0  - pi 2 ln q   pi  b  silon p      db  oplus oplus   substack l in NN

Generators of the dual von Neumann algebra
 By Theorem thm Casimirwelldefinedandchar and strongly commute with the Casimir  Since there are elements in that anti-commute with see Proposition prop decompMintoM andM-andgradedcommutation cannot be generated by and alone  So we need to find extra operators that  together with and generate the dual von Neumann algebra  It is the purpose of this section to describe a generating set for i e   to prove Theorem thm generatorsforhatM  We do so by establishing a generator of see  eqre feq defQppn  and Proposition prop QppngeneratedualM as the composition of a partial isometry and an operator expressed in terms of the Casimir operator  The partial isometries occurring in this way give us the required additional generators for the dual von Neumann algebra  Throughout this section we fix  Furthermore  we set and and assume unless explicitly stated otherwise  In this case the operator is non-zero by Lemma lem explicitactionQppn

   eqre feq spectrum--    eqre feq spectrum     So we have to keep track which of the eigenvectors in correspond to eigenvalues in the spectrum of in   Proof of Proposition prop discretesubrepresinregrepr   Note that and  Since it follows that  In order to see that consider where  It follows from  eqre feq spectrum -    eqre feq spectrum--  and  eqre feq spectrum    that if there exist and such that then  Assume first that  It follows from  eqre feq spectrum    that an eigenvector is non-zero if and only if such that  So such an eigenvector exists for all  It follows from  eqre feq spectrum--  that such an eigenvector does not exist  since the discrete spectrum of on is always negative  A check shows that eigenvectors satisfying exist precisely when  Similarly  eigenvectors satisfying exist precisely when  This covers the case  i  of Proposition prop discretesubrepresinregrepr  For the remainder of the proof we assume  Since it cannot happen that and  We start by looking at eigenvectors for positive eigenvalues of in for  From  eqre feq spectrum -  it follows that such eigenvectors occur for the eigenvalue in precisely when and that such eigenvectors occur for the eigenvalue in precisely when  So these cases cannot occur simultaneously  and we consider them separately  From  eqre feq spectrum    we find eigenvectors in case or  Using  eqre feq spectrum--  we see that is an eigenvector for the eigenvalue precisely when or for the case i e   In case or we see that is an eigenvector for the eigenvalue precisely when or  Assume and hence  Then we find no eigenvectors of type and for all by  eqre feq spectrum -   We find for all with by considering the case and separately in  eqre feq spectrum     Consider now  eqre feq spectrum--   In case  or  we find eigenvectors for which is excluded in this case  or  So in total we get for  In case  or  we find eigenvectors for which is excluded since it implies and for  So we find for  Combining we find for all with  This gives case  ii  of Proposition prop discretesubrepresinregrepr  Case  iii  is obtained similarly by analyzing and hence  Next we show that the corresponding unitary corepresentations of are irreducible   Proof of Proposition prop Wpxgivesirreduciblediscreteseries   We have already observed that is invariant  Consider with the convention with as in Proposition prop discretesubrepresinregrepr and assume for the moment that or  We claim that is possible to choose so that em skip em for  Take such that which is possible by the assumption  By Proposition prop discretesubrepresinregrepr we find by inspection that in case  i   in case  ii  and in case  iii  gives the required choice  Recall that is affiliated to see Proposition prop KEaffiliatedtohatM  Thus  if denotes the spectral projection of with respect to the eigenvalue we find  So is the orthogonal projection onto the closed subspace spanned by  But by our choice of and this implies that is the orthogonal projection onto  So we can look at the invariant subspace of generated by the vector  Consider the closure of so that is an invariant subspace of and  Using Lemma lem actionsofgeneratorsoneigvetsOm the partial isometry in the polar decomposition of maps to if this corresponds to an eigenvector of in and to zero if this is not the case  Using Lemma lem actionsofgeneratorsoneigvetsOm and the fact that the partial isometry by Proposition prop EaffiliatedtohatM we see that all other vectors in the three lists for in Proposition prop discretesubrepresinregrepr can be reached by repeated application of and  Hence and irreducibility follows  In case we cannot establish that is the orthogonal projection on a single vector in the lists as in Proposition prop discretesubrepresinregrepr but we can view it  by taking as an orthogonal projection on the subspace in case  i  of Proposition prop discretesubrepresinregrepr on in case  ii  and on in case  iii   Now use the fact that the partial isometry of kills the second vector in each of these spaces to see that the range of the composition has dimension spanned by in case  i   by in case  ii  and by in case  iii   Now we can argue as in the case above to find that is irreducible

Identities for special functions

Summation formulas from the action of
 We start by proving the summation formulas in Section ssec formulas2phi1 which essentially follow by the action of with respect to the spectral decomposition of the Casimir operator   Proof of Theorem thm introsummationformula1   In Lemma lem actionTC x  we computed how the operator defined by  eqre feq defTp1p2n  acts on functions in  In this computation we actually proved a summation formula involving the functions and the orthonormal functions which are essentially Al-Salam--Chihara polynomials and little -Jacobi functions  Here we write out explicitly  i e   in terms of basic hypergeometric functions  the summation formula corresponding to the case   in this case both -functions appearing in the formula are little -Jacobi functions  i e   non-terminating -functions  This is a rather tedious  but straightforward computation  The second case follows similarly using  The product formula from Lemma lem identitiesC leads to the summation formula in Theorem thm introsumfromstructureformula with the same structure as the formula from Theorem thm introsummationformula1   Proof of Theorem thm introsumfromstructureformula   We first write the formula from Lemma lem identitiesC in terms of the -functions  where we denoted and canceled common factors  Now the result follows from expressing the -functions as -functions and the -functions as -functions  see Proposition prop S 2phi1 and Definition def functionap  Observe that the sum in Theorem thm introsumfromstructureformula is actually a single sum  If we denote then and we can write the above sum as a sum over where if or and if  Furthermore  if we set  this implies   and we use the second symmetry relation from Lemma lem symmetryS for the function the left hand side in  eqre feq productformulaS  contains the product which is positive  this corresponds to the operator  So we find     -1    chi p 2 p 1    sgn p 1    chi p 1    sgn p 2    chi p 2    sum   x 1 x 2   in  mathcal A  a  x 1  p 1 p 1  a  x 2  p 2 p 2  S  x 1 x 2 0  > 0     This leads to Corollary cor positivity  For the definition of the complementary series corepresentations of in Section ssec complementaryseries the following lemma is crucial for showing that it is indeed a corepresentation  The identity from Theorem thm introsumfromstructureformula is also valid for  Consequently  if the product formula for the function in Lemma lem identitiesC  i  also holds for with First we prove that the identity from Theorem thm introsumfromstructureformula or equivalently  eqre feq productformulaS   is also valid for  Actually  we prove a stronger result  the identity  eqre feq productformulaS  holds for all  Recall that  for and the function is analytic on  So clearly the left hand side of  eqre feq productformulaS  is analytic in on  We show that the right hand side of  eqre feq productformulaS  also defines an analytic function  then the result follows from analytic continuation  Let and  Assume where is a compact set  then there exists a constant such that and  We define by    g x    q  3 chi x  B   chi x    	 x q q 
 q  - n m  chi x    	 x q 1     By Lemma lem asymptoticsforS there exists a constant such that    |S  x 1 x 2 n m | < C g |x 1|      for  Furthermore  by Lemma lem estimate1 there exists a constant such that    |a x r p | q D  q   chi x   chi r p - frac32   q   hf  chi x  2    qquad x r p  in I q     so that    |a  x 1  r 1 p 1 a   sgn r 2p 2 |x 1|  r 2 p 2 | q D q   chi x 1   chi r 1r 2 p 1p 2 -3  q   chi x 1  2      for some constant  Because of the factor the sum     sum  x  q   chi x   chi r 1r 2 p 1p 2 -3  q   chi x  2  g x     converges absolutely  Here the sum is over in case or and over in case  It follows that the right hand side of  eqre feq productformulaS  converges uniformly on hence it is analytic on  Finally  let  We multiply  eqre feq productformulaS  by       hf 1- sgn p 1r 1     et   hf 1- sgn p 2r 2    fra c A - sgn p 1r 1p 2r 2   p k m n   sgn p 1r 1   sgn p 2r 2  et     A -  p k   et       then we obtain the desired product formula for the function as in Lemma lem identitiesC  i   with  Let us remark that with the same arguments as in the proof of Lemma lem analyticcontinuation it follows that the product formula for the function holds for all if  Note that the points correspond to discrete series corepresentations  and at these points the product formula is of course also valid  In this case the functions are essentially square roots of residues of -functions 
Biorthogonality relations
 In the proof of Lemma lem explicitWpx we obtained orthogonality relations for the function for the case with  These relations lead to biorthogonality relations for the functions  which by analytic continuation hold for all  We need these biorthogonality relations for in order to show that the complementary series corepresentations are unitary  Let and  The set     p 2 mapsto S  sgn p 1   p 1 p 2  chi p 1p 2  m   mid p 1  in I q     is basis for with dual basis     p 2 mapsto S  sgn p 1  overlin e    -1  p 1 p 2  chi p 1p 2  m   mid p 1  in I q      Similarly  the set     p 1 mapsto S  sgn p 1   p 1 p 2  chi p 1p 2  m   mid p 2  in I q     is a basis for with dual basis     p 1 mapsto S  sgn p 1  overlin e    -1  p 1 p 2  chi p 1p 2  m   mid p 2  in I q      First assume with  From unitarity of and the explicit expressions for and we obtain orthogonality and dual orthogonality relations for the matrix elements  Indeed  from writing out we find  for and    e  p 1p 1      sum  p 2 in I q  	 C  sgn p 2 y m- chi p 1   sgn p 1   et p 1 p 2  chi p 2p 1 p -2m

Al-Salam--Chihara polynomials
 The spectral analysis of Jacobi operators on and plays an essential role in this paper  We refer to Berezanski u i  Pruitt Prui Masson and Repka MassR Kakehi Kake see also for general information on Jacobi operators on  We use KoelLaredo for general reference  The spectral decomposition of the Jacobi operators we encounter are described with the help of certain special functions  namely the Al-Salam--Chihara polynomials and the little -Jacobi functions  In this subsection we collect some results and notations for the Al-Salam--Chihara polynomials  Results for little -Jacobi functions are given in the next subsection  The Al-Salam--Chihara polynomials were introduced by Al-Salam and Chihara in AlSaC to classify all orthogonal polynomials satisfying a convolution type property  These polynomials also have been studied by Askey and Ismail  The Al-Salam--Chihara polynomials form subfamily of the Askey-Wilson polynomials Askey and Wilson AskeW Gasper and Rahman  Consider  For the Al-Salam--Chihara polynomials are defined by for  The equality in  eqre feq AlSCpol  follows from and holds if  We see that for the polynomials are real-valued  The Al-Salam--Chihara polynomials satisfy the three-term recurrence relation with initial condition  From this relation we see that the Al-Salam--Chihara polynomials are symmetric in and  Favard s Theorem gives that these polynomials are orthogonal with respect to a positive measure on the real line for which from now on we assume to hold  The measure can be determined from the asymptotic behaviour of the Al-Salam--Chihara polynomials as the degree tends to infinity  This behaviour is determined by valid if where We extend the -function by continuity to all points of where possible  The asymptotic behaviour can be obtained as a limiting case  of the asymptotic behaviour of the Askey-Wilson polynomials or by using with and next  eqre feq AlSCpol  and the -product identity  eqre feq thetaprodid   See also for the asymptotic behaviour using Darboux s method including the cases  The corresponding orthonormal Al-Salam--Chihara polynomials are defined by for all  The orthonormal Al-Salam--Chihara polynomials satisfy the recurrence relation and initial conditions  Note that the coefficients and are bounded  since we assume  Under our assumption the Al-Salam--Chihara polynomials are orthogonal with respect to a positive measure on   where the measure is defined by with    w r a b mid q     fra c a  -2  q   infty  a 2 ab q  r  1-a 2q  2r      b a q   infty  q aq b q  r  1-a 2   q  -r 2  a  -3r b  -r      Note that the weight function in  eqre feq orthoAlSCpol  is very explicit  It can be rewritten in terms of the -function  eqre feq cfunctionforAlSCpols  as where the set is given by    D  D a b mid q      s in  C  mid |s|>1   c s a b mid q  0      and we assume that the zeroes of the -function in are simple  The two sets of discrete mass points in the measure in  eqre feq orthoAlSCpol  are finite  If at most one of the sets of discrete mass points can occur  since we also assume  If then both series of discrete mass points can occur  Consider the corresponding Jacobi operator on equipped with the standard orthonormal basis with and as in  eqre feq recAlSCpol   initially defined on the dense domain of finite linear combinations of the basis vectors  Since the coefficients are bounded  extends uniquely to a bounded self-adjoint operator on  If we need to stress the dependence on the parameters  we write  The resolution of the identity for the self-adjoint extension of can be described with the orthonormal Al-Salam--Chihara polynomials and the corresponding orthogonality measure  The Jacobi operator extends uniquely to a bounded self-adjoint operator on  Let be the resolution of the identity for the self-adjoint extension of then for any Borel set and we have For the purposes in this paper we want to rewrite the orthogonality relations  eqre feq orthoAlSCpol  for the Al-Salam--Chihara polynomials as orthogonality relations on where is the support of so in accordance with  eqre feq orthoAlSCpolRES   On we take the Lebesgue measure  and on the discrete part we take the counting measure  Now define for where is either or and is the other parameter  and with  So is an orthonormal basis for  It follows in particular that so that the functions have -norm for  The orthogonality relations  eqre feq orthonAlScrelationsdisc  can also be proved directly using the -binomial theorem and the -Saalsch  utz formula and it is related to a discrete measure on for which only a finite number of moments exist  The polynomials and the -function are symmetric in which implies the symmetry relation Another symmetry that we need is which follows from writing out explicitly as a multiple of a -function  The asymptotic behaviour of the orthonormal basis of as the degree tends to can be obtained from  eqre feq asymptbehaviourAlSCpol   For we find and see for the case  Observe that the expression is symmetric with respect to  On the discrete spectrum the zeroes of the -function make the first term on the right hand side of  eqre feq asymptbehaviourAlSCpol  vanish  so that the behaviour of is given by This implies for in the discrete spectrum  The expression for follows from  eqre feq asymptoticnormalAlSCfdisc  by interchanging and in the right hand side  We can also reformulate  eqre feq asymptoticnormalAlSCfdisc  as for assuming such zeroes of the -function are simple  In this paper we need a certain contiguous relations for the Al-Salam--Chihara polynomials  The contiguous relation can be looked upon as an operator that can be used for a Darboux factorization of the Jacobi operator  The orthonormal basis functions satisfy     sqr t1-2bx b 2    h n x a b mid q     sqr t1-abq n    h n x a bq mid q  - b  sqr t1-q n    h  n-1  x a bq mid q      for  From the connection coefficient formula it follows that This can also be obtained directly from the second explicit expression of in  eqre feq AlSCpol  by writing out the -function as a sum  and using the identity  Rewriting  eqre feq contigrelAlScpols  for the orthonormal basis gives the desired relation  For this follows directly from  eqre feq ortonAlSCpol    eqre feq deffnabqforASCpol   and for in the discrete spectrum this is a consequence of  fra cw r a bq mid q   w r a b mid q

 In this subsection we collect the results and notations for the little -Jacobi functions needed in this paper  The little -Jacobi functions are the kernel of an explicit transform pair that is related to the spectral analysis of the hypergeometric -difference equation  and they arise as matrix elements for the quantum group  see MasuMNNSU  References for this subsection are Kakehi Kake Kakehi et al  KakeMU and also KoelLaredo KoelSTempe  The hypergeometric -difference equation  see can be rewritten as for a function and one explicit solution of  eqre feq hypqdiffeq  is  Using the hypergeometric -difference we find solutions to where we assume from now on that and  For more general sets of parameters  see  Indeed  we find the solution  where we from now on assume in order to avoid complications for  We use the notation if we want to stress the dependence on the parameters  Note that replacing and by and leaves  eqre feq 2ndordqdiffeq  invariant  hence is also a solution to  eqre feq 2ndordqdiffeq   as can also be checked directly from  eqre feq hypqdiffeq   These solutions are linearly independent for  The equation  eqre feq 2ndordqdiffeq  can also be viewed for as the recurrence relation for the  suitably renormalized  associated Al-Salam--Chihara polynomials  and the description of the solution space matches Gupta  Ismail and Masson GuptIM  Next we define then  for and define two linearly independent solutions to  eqre feq 2ndordqdiffeqBHS  as follows easily from  eqre feq hypqdiffeq   We use the notation if we want to stress the dependence on the parameters  Note that are invariant under replacing and by and  Since the solution space to  eqre feq 2ndordqdiffeq  is two-dimensional there are relations between the solutions  in particular  which follows from for  As in the previous subsection we extend this -function by continuity to all points of where possible  We use the notation if we want to stress the dependence on the parameters  Note that this -function is different from the one for the Al-Salam--Chihara polynomials in Section ssecB AlSCpol  In this subsection is defined by  eqre feq cfunctions   The corresponding orthonormal recurrence relation  i e   the normalization which makes the corresponding Jacobi operator symmetric  is Note that we assume so that the square root is well-defined  We put where the second expression follows from the -product identity  eqre feq thetaprodid   then satisfies  eqre feq reclqJacf  if and only if satisfies  eqre feq 2ndordqdiffeq   We use the notation if we want to stress the dependence on the parameters  Now the following orthogonality relations hold  where the measure is defined by     int  R g x    d nu x c d z mid q   	  fra c1  2 pi   int 0  pi g  cos psi   fra cd psi  |c e  i psi  | 2     sum   stackrel  scriptstyle r in Z    scriptstyle |q  1-r  dz|>1    g  mu q  1-r  dz   v r

Special case of a Jacobi operator
 In this section we study the special case of the Jacobi operator defined by  eqre feq JacobioperatorreclqJacf   For special choices of and the operator is a certain restriction of or the Casimir operator  see Section ssec spectraldecompCasimir  The operator that we consider in this subsection corresponds to the case  Let be the space of complex-valued functions on  We study the linear operator given by    2   ld eL  c u  k   a  k-1  c   u  k-1    b k c    u k   a k c    u  k 1     for all and  The coefficients and are given by  eqre feq reclqJacf   and we write instead of to stress the dependence on the parameter  Recall from Section ssecB litteqJacobi that and so that both terms in the square root are positive  and and  We define the linear operator as the restriction of to the linear subspace of finite linear combinations of basis vectors  i e   the subspace of compactly supported functions in  Then is an unbounded symmetric operator on the Hilbert space  Moreover  the unboundedness occurs as since in this case the coefficients and grow exponentially  Note that for the coefficients and remain bounded  In this subsection we need the Wronskian associated to the Jacobi operator   see  Two eigenfunctions of are linearly independent if and only if  The remainder of this subsection furnishes the proof the following result  Consider so that and so that there exists a function that is differentiable in and satisfies and for all  Then there exists a unique self-adjoint extension of so that  Moreover  if and if there exists a function that is differentiable in and satisfies for all then as well  The resolution of the identity for the self-adjoint extension of is given by    ngle E  T    mathcal B  u v rangle   ell 2  Z      int   mathcal B    mathcal F  Tu x   overlin e  mathcal F  Tv x     d nu x q d z mid q    qquad   mathcal F  Tu x     sum  k - infty   infty u k  rho k f k x      for any Borel set and any  Observe that the resolution of the identity is the same as in Theorem thm spectraldecompL with
 For the proof we need the eigenfunctions of the operator  For and let us denote where and are defined by  eqre feq 2ndordqdiffeqBHS  and  eqre feq deflqJacfweight   respectively  From Section ssecB litteqJacobi we know that and are both solutions of the eigenvalue equation  Another solution is the function    ld eF  c y  k    rho k c d z mid q  F k y c d z mid q      see  eqre feq 2ndordqdiffeqBHS3  for the definition of  In it is shown that the operator has deficiency indices in case  The proof of this fact relies on the fact that the functions and are both in the space for  In case we have so we must provide another eigenvector for  Let  We define ld eh  y  k    lim  c arrow q      fra c lde f  c y  k - ld eg  c y  k   c - q   for all k  in  Z  For we have    ld eL  c      fra c lde f  c y  - ld eg  c y   c-q        mu y      fra c lde f  c y  - ld eg  c y   c-q        Since the coefficients of depend continuously on and is independent of the above equality together with Definition def eigenfunction h imply that  Let us establish the asymptotics of as  Consider  Then there exists a convergent sequence in and a differentiable function such that and for all  Define the -functions such that    B c x       rphi s2  1  dy  d y  c  q z x  and C c x       rphi s2  1  qdy c  qd yc  q 2 c  q z x     for all  We have for that    ld ef  c y   -k  - ld eg  c y   -k    w  -k  c      B c q k  -  q c  k   C c q k         where    w k c     c z q z q   infty d  -k   rho k c d z mid q      Therefore  ld eh  y   -k    w  -k  q    l    tial 1 B  q q k  -  tial 1 C  q q k     k q    C q q k    r  Now define the -function such that    D c x    c q   infty  sqr t frac  z x q   infty    d 2 z c  qc d 2 z z q z q   infty    d 2 z x c q   infty   for all c  in  q 2 1     x  in  R         Now  eqre feq deflqJacfweight  shows that for all  Thus  ld eh  y   -k    q   frac k  2     D q q k      tial 1 B  q q k  -  tial 1 C  q q k         q  -1    k  q   frac k  2      D q q k    C q q k        Note that  So the lemma follows  Let  Then belongs to and there exists a convergent sequence in and a differentiable function so that and for all  Definition  eqre feq 2ndordqdiffeqBHS  and  eqre feq deflqJacfweight  imply that converges as  Since converges to as and  by Lemma lem h r f converges to a non-zero number as we conclude that and are linearly independent  Because and belong to the eigenspace of for the eigenvalue and since such an eigenspace is always two-dimensional  there exist complex numbers and so that  Clearly  this gives see  eqre feq Wronskian   By we know that implying that  Hence  Lemma lem h r f and the remarks in the beginning of this proof guarantee the existence of a convergent sequence in and a differentiable function so that and for all  So we immediately get that is as  Definition  eqre feq 2ndordqdiffeqBHS3  and  eqre feq deflqJacfweight  imply that is as since  So we conclude that  Note that Lemma lem F r h applies to so  Since belongs to the vector belongs to and  This implies that is not essentially self-adjoint  Let be functions that are differentiable in a sequence in such that converges to  Then converges to  For write    r k   f q  k-1  	  g q k - f q k   g q  k-1
