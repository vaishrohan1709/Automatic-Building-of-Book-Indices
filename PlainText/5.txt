Introduction
 Inspired by the Langlands program  Deligne suggested that the constant appearing in the functional equation of the -function of an -adic sheaf  on a smooth proper curve over a finite field of characteristic should factor as product of local contributions  later called epsilon factors  at each closed point of the curve  He conjectured a product formula and showed some particular cases of it  cf   Del sem  This formula was proven by Laumon in the outstanding paper Lau  The goal of this article is to prove a product formula for -adic epsilon factors of arithmetic -modules on a curve  This formula generalizes the conjecture formulated in Marmora Facteurs epsilon for epsilon factors of overconvergent -isocrystals  and it is an analog in rigid cohomology of the Deligne-Laumon formula  Let us give some notation  In this introduction we simplify the exposition by assuming more hypotheses than necessary  and we refer to the article for the general statements  Let be a finite field of characteristic and let be its cardinality  Let be a smooth  proper and geometrically connected curve over  We are interested in rigid cohomology Berthelot prepub on which is a good -adic theory in the sense that it is a Weil cohomology  The coefficients for this theory are the overconvergent -isocrystals  they play the role of the smooth sheaves in -adic cohomology  or vector bundles with  flat  connection in complex analytic geometry  These coefficients are also known in the literature as -adic differential equations  As their -adic and complex analogs  the overconvergent -isocrystals form a category which is not stable under push-forward in general  Berthelot Ber rigD inspired by algebraic analysis  proposed a framework to remedy this problem by introducing arithmetic - -modules  shortly - -modules  and in particular the subcategory of holonomic modules  see BerInt for a survey  Thanks to works of many people    e g    Caro courbes Cr3      we have a satisfactory theory  at least in the curve case  We note that another approach to -adic cohomologies has been initiated by Mebkhout and Narvaez-Macarro MeNa and is giving interesting developments  for example see ArMe  Although it would certainly be interesting to transpose our calculations into this theory  we place ourselves exclusively in the context of Berthelot s arithmetic -modules throughout this paper  Nevertheless  we point out that Christol-Mebkhout s results in the local theory of -adic differential equations are indispensable both explicitly and implicitly in this article  The local theory of arithmetic -modules has been developed by Crew  cf   Cr3 Cr  and we will use it extensively in our work  To state the -adic product formula let us review the definitions of local and global epsilon factors for holonomic -modules  The Poincar√© duality was established for overconvergent -isocrystals in the works of Berthelot BePoinc Crew Crew ens and Kedlaya KeDuke and for the theory of -modules by the first author Abe3 based on the results of Virrion Vir  This gives a functional equation for the -function  Caro Caro courbes Etesse-LeStum LE  of see  Ssb main  The constant appearing in this functional equation is where is the structural morphism  and it is called the global epsilon factor of  The local epsilon factor of an arithmetic -module at a closed point of is defined up to the choice of a meromorphic differential form on  To define it  we restrict to the complete   trait  of at  To define the local factors we consider a localizing triangle  cf    anotherloctriag   hence  by linearity  it remains to define the epsilon factors for punctual modules and for free differential modules on the Robba ring with Frobenius structure  The former case is explicit  the latter was done in Marmora Facteurs epsilon via the Weil-Deligne representation attached to free differential modules by the -adic monodromy theorem  The product formula  Theorem Product formula  states that for any holonomic - -module on we have where is the genus of denotes the generic rank of is the set of closed points of and is a meromorphic differential form on  This formula can be seen as a multiplicative generalization of Grothendieck-Ogg-Shafarevich formulas in rigid cohomology  The proof of  intro PF  starts by following the track of Laumon  a geometric argument  see  reduces to prove the fundamental case where and is an -isocrystal overconvergent along a closed set of rational points of  by refining the argument we can even take cf    By saying that is an -isocrystal  we mean that it is an arithmetic -module corresponding to an -isocrystal via the specialization map  see the convention  Sconventionocisoc  In order to conclude  we need four components   1  a canonical extension functor from the category of holonomic - -modules on the formal disk to that of holonomic - -modules on the projective line  overconvergent at    2  the proof of  eqre fintro PF  for -modules in the essential image of this functor   3  the   principle   of stationary phase  for modules whose differential slopes at infinity are less than    4  an exact sequence in the style   nearby-vanishing cycles   for certain kinds of -modules  The first component is provided by the work of Crew Cr extending the canonical extension of Matsuda for overconvergent -isocrystals  The second is technical but not difficult to achieve  The third is the deepest among these four  and a large part of this paper is devoted to it  This   principle   can roughly be described by saying that it provides a description of the behavior at infinity of the Fourier-Huyghe transform of in terms of local contributions at closed points in where is singular    i e    the characteristic cycle of does contain a vertical component at cf   paragraph stabledef  These   local contributions   are called local Fourier transforms  LFT  of and one of the key points of our work is to provide a good construction of them  Here  we differentiate from the work of Laumon  who used vanishing cycles to construct the local Fourier transform of an -adic sheaf  A definition of local Fourier transform has been given by Crew following the classical path  take the canonical extension of a holonomic - -module at then apply the Fourier-Huyghe transform  and finally restrict around  However  we need more information on the internal structure of LFT  and therefore  we redefine it  Our approach is based on microlocalization inspired by the classical works of Malgrange Malgrange Eq diff and Sabbah Sabbah isomono  Yet  there are many more technical difficulties in our case because we need to deal with differential operators of infinite order  We note that the definition is still not completely local in the sense that it uses the canonical extension and the Frobenius is constructed by global methods  Once we have established some fundamental properties of LFT  the proof of the regular stationary phase is analogous to that of Sabbah Sabbah isomono in the classical case  see also Lopez Microloc for its generalizations   The fourth component is proved using an exact sequence of Crew Cr Noot-Huyghe s results on Fourier transform  and the properties of cohomological operations proven in Abe3  The end of the proof of  eqre fintro PF  is classical and it follows again Laumon  although there are still some differences from the -adic case that we have carefully pointed out in  Ssb proof gen case  In particular  in   loc   cit    we detail the proof of a determinant formula for the -adic epsilon factor  This -adic formula gives a differential interpretation of the local epsilon factors and promises to have new applications  Indeed  in  Sexplicitcalcfrob we give an explicit description of the Frobenius acting on the Fourier-Huyghe transform  This might provide explicit information on the -adic epsilon factors  and moreover have arithmetic spin-offs  For example  in the case of a Kummer isocrystal  by carrying out this calculation and applying the product formula we can re-prove the Gross-Koblitz formula  This and related questions will be addressed in a future paper  Concerning -adic theory  we point out that Abbes and Saito AS have recently given an interesting new local description of LFT as well as an alternative proof of Laumon s determinant formula for -adic representations satisfying a certain ramification condition  Finally  regarding Langlands program for -adic coefficients  we mention the recent preprint Abe4 where the -adic product formula is used to show the equivalence between the  conjectural  -adic Langlands correspondence for over function fields and Deligne s hope for petits camarades cristallins cf   and also  skip After this introduction  this article is divided into seven sections  Here  we briefly describe their content  more information can be found in the text at the beginning of each section and subsection  The aim of the first section is to define the characteristic cycles of holonomic -modules on curves over the field  which is supposed here only of characteristic   and prove some relations with the microlocalizations  For this  we prove a level stability theorem using microlocal techniques of Abe  The section starts with a short survey of microdifferential operators of   loc   cit   The second section begins the study of local Fourier transforms for holonomic -modules  This section is the technical core of the paper  We start in  SCrewreview by a review of Crew s theory of arithmetic -modules on a formal disk  then we study in  Sanalye the relations between microlocalization and analytification of -modules  This gives several applications  namely the equality between Garnier s and Christol-Mebkhout s definitions of irregularity   Sapplithem  We finish the section by giving an alternative definition of local Fourier transform  except for the Frobenius structure  in  Ssecdefforloc  We will see in  Ssection4 that this LFT coincides with that of Crew and we will complete the definition in  Ssection5 by endowing it with the Frobenius structure  The third section reviews the cohomological operations on arithmetic -modules  In particular  in  Scohoprev we recall the results of Abe3 which are used in this paper  and in  Ssecgeforev we review the global Fourier transform of Noot-Huyghe  The fourth section is devoted to the regular stationary phase  In  Ssecgeomcalc we establish some numerical results analogous to those of Laumon for perverse -adic sheaves  In  Ssecregstfo we prove the stationary phase for regular holonomic modules on the projective line  It is in the fifth section that we finally implement the Frobenius in the theory  In  Ssecfroblocfou we endow the local Fourier transform with the Frobenius induced by that of the global Fourier transform via the stationary phase isomorphism  In section  Sexplicitcalcfrob we explicitly describe the Frobenius on the naive Fourier transform  The sixth section provides a key exact sequence for the proof of the product formula  This sequence should be seen as an analog of the exact sequence of vanishing cycles appearing in Laumon s proof of the -adic product formula  The section begins with a result on commutation of the Frobenius in  Ssecommfrob and we then prove the exactness of the sequence in  Ssecanexse  Finally  in the last section  we state and prove the -adic product formula  We begin in  Ssb Loc con with the definition of local factors of holonomic modules  then  in  Ssb main we recall the definition of the -function attached to a holonomic module and define the global epsilon factor  We state the product formula and we show that it is in fact equivalent to the product formula for overconvergent -isocrystals conjectured in Marmora Facteurs epsilon  The section continues with the proof of the product formula  some preliminary particular cases in  Sproof geo mod and the general case  as well as the determinant formula for local epsilon factors  in  Ssb proof gen case

Stability theorem for characteristic cycles on curves
 The definition of stable holonomic module  stabledef  and the stability theorem  stabilitytheoremcy  are the goal of this section  Theorem stabilitytheoremcy is needed to prove the product formula for holonomic -modules with Frobenius structure on a curve over a finite field  Nevertheless  in this section  we tried to state the theorems in the more possible generality  in particular  we do not require to be perfect  neither we assume the existence of a Frobenius structure on -modules  Even if we put Frobenius structures  we do not know if the proof of the stability theorem could be simplified 
Review of microdifferential operators
 We review the definitions and properties of the arithmetic microdifferential sheaves on curves  which are going to be used extensively in this paper  For the general definitions in higher dimensional settings and more details  see Abe

 Let be a formal curve over  We denote its special fiber by  Let be the cotangent bundle of and be the canonical projection  We put where denotes the zero section     miscellaneous pi    Let be an integer and be a coherent -module  One of the basic ideas of microlocalization is to   localize   over to make possible a more detailed analysis on  For this  we define step by step the sheaves of rings on the cotangent bundle   microdifferential operators naive |   Let be a non-negative integer  Let us define first  For the detail of this construction  see  There are mainly two types of rings of sections of  Let be an open subset of  If is non empty  we get  Suppose that the intersection is empty  Let  Then the ring of sections of on is equal to that on and the ring of these sections is the   microlocalization   of  Let us describe locally the sections  Shrink so that it possesses a local coordinate denoted by  We denote the corresponding differential operator by  There exists an integer such that is in the center of  Let be the multiplicative system generated by in  The positive filtration on given by the order of differential operators  induces a ring filtration  necessarily indexed by on the localization  Thus the elements in can have negative order  but they are   finite   in the sense that only finitely many negative powers of can appear in  the total symbol of  each of them  We define  Gamma  U    Emo dm  X i     l S  -1  Gamma  pi  U      Dmo dm  X i   r   wedge  as the completion of this filtered ring with respect to negative order  see for our conventions on the completion of a filtered ring   Taking an inverse limit over we define  The sections of can be described concretely as follows  Let be an open subset of and assume to be affine  Let be the open formal subscheme sitting over  Suppose moreover that possesses a local coordinate and we denote the corresponding differential operator by  For an integer take the minimal integer such that and let  By the construction of the operator in considered as a section of is invertible  and the inverse is denoted by  Then we put  By using we get  Gamma  U   Ecom pm   m sX    cong Bigl  sum  k in mb Z  a k tial   angles m  k   Big arrowvert a k in m cO    ms V    lim   k arrow  infty a k 0  Bigr   Finally  by tensoring with we define  One of the most important properties of is that we get an equality for any coherent -module  cf     m rChar    m    m sM    m rSupp   Ecomp Qm   m sX   otimes    pi  -1  Dcomp Qm   m sX    pi  -1  m sM    where  characteristic variety and cycle Char    denotes the characteristic variety of level  cf    The module is called the  naive  microlocalization of of level  The ring is called the  naive  microdifferential operators of level

 In the last paragraph  we fixed the level to construct the ring of microdifferential operators  However  to deal with microlocalizations of -modules  we need to change levels and see the asymptotic behavior  The problem is that there are no reasonable transition homomorphism for non-negative integers  To remedy this  we need to take an   intersection    Let where  microdifferential operators naive |   denotes the sub- -module of consisting of microdifferential operators of order less than or equal to and put  Then there exists a canonical homomorphism of -algebras sending to  We define   microdifferential operators intermediate  1  |   By definition  is the -adic completion of and is  When possesses a local coordinate we may write  Gamma  mathrin gT    X   Ecomp Qm m    m sX    cong Biggl   sum  k in mb Z  a k tial  k  Bigg arrowvert a k in m cO    ms X   m bQ    sum  k<0 a k tial  k   in Ecom pm    m sX   m bQ     sum  k q0 a k tial  k  in Ecom pm   m sX   m bQ   Biggr   We note that the last condition is equivalent to  Moreover  by construction of the expansion satisfying the above conditions is unique  once the local coordinate is fixed  and so is  For an integer we put  We have canonical homomorphisms and  cf    We call these sheaves the intermediate rings of microdifferential operators  We also recall the following definitions   microdifferential operators    where the transition maps are induced by the canonical homomorphisms above  cf  for more details 

 Now  let us explain the relation between the supports of the microlocalizations of a -module with respect to intermediate rings and the characteristic variety  Let be a formal curve as in the last paragraph  and let be a coherent -module  One might expect that  for integers This does not hold in general as we can see by the counter-example  However  the statement holds for large enough  The following is one of main results of Abe        There exists an integer such that   normalfont charintemicro   holds for
Setup and preliminaries
 In this paragraph  we introduce some situations and notation  In this paper  especially in the first two sections  we often consider the following setting  which is called   Situation  L    Let be an affine formal curve over  Recall the convention defRmsX especially and  Suppose that there exists a local coordinate in and fix it  We denote the corresponding differential operator by  If moreover we assume the following  we say we are in   Situation  Ls    Let be a closed point in and we fix it  We suppose that there exists a local parameter at denoted by on  We use the following notation  Let be a formal curve over and be an open affine formal subscheme of  We denote by as usual  Let be non-negative integers   newcounte renumipp  em We put 	 	 	 	   microdifferential operators  2     microdifferential operators intermediate  2    em Let be one of  For a coherent 	 -module we denote by 	 or the -module 	  em Let be a closed point in  Take a point in 	 which is not in the zero 	section  Let be one of sheaves of rings 	 or  By the construction of the fiber 	 does not depend on the choice of and 	we denote it by  	Let a pair be one of the four pairs 	 	 	 	  For a coherent 	 or -module we 	write for 	  This does not depend either on the choice of 	  	We warn the reader that even if is complete with respect to some topology we do not complete when we take the fiber at   microdifferential operators intermediate  1  |    microdifferential operators  3     setcounte renumipp   heenumi  Moreover  assume that we are in Situation  L    setcounte renumi   heenumipp  em We denote by the subring of whose elements are   horizontal with respect to     More precisely  we define  C R ms X    tial    m m      Bigl P  sum  n in mb Z   a n tial  n  in Ecomp bm m    m sX   Big arrowvert  mbo x for any   Bigr   We put and  We note that by the hypothesis of Situation  L   the coordinate is fixed  and so is   microdifferential operators intermediate  3     i  Let be a sheaf of rings on a topological space  Then an -module is said to be   globally finitely presented  if there exist integers and an exact sequence on the topological space  By when is affine  there exists an equivalence of categories between the category of globally finitely presented -modules  resp   -modules  on and that of -modules  resp   -modules   We remind here that if there exists a coherent -module such that then is globally finitely presented  and the same for -modules   ii  Let be the natural projection  A sheaf on is called conic if the natural morphism is an isomorphism  In particular  the support of such a sheaf is a conic subset of   i e  if then  By construction the sheaves of microdifferentials are conic  where stands for any of the sheaves etc  introduced before   Since this is clearly a local property  it follows that any coherent -module is also conic   iii  Every element in the ring can be written uniquely as with in a finite √©tale extension of  cf   K Xnotdef fieldconstmicdif   which coincides with if and only if is geo -metrically connected  The rings and are subrings of and respectively  We remind that they   do  depend on the choice of local coordinate and in particular  we are not able to globalize the construction 

 Let be an affine formal curve over and let be one of the rings or  We finish this subsection by introducing some useful topologies on and on finitely generated -modules  Let s start with  For integers we define a sub- -module of by U  k l     Ecomp bm m    m sX     -k   varpi l Ecomp bm m    m sX    We endow with the topology denoted by where the base of neighborhoods of zero is given by the system  With this topology  is a complete topological ring  Let us see that it is complete with respect to this topology  Let be a Cauchy sequence in  Then we may write such that  for any integers and there exists an integer such that and for any  By the definition of the topology and the construction of the ring the limits and exist  and they are denoted by and respectively  Then we see that by definition  Now  let us define topologies and for any integer on  Let be an integer  For integers we can consider as a sub- -module of and we denote by the topology on generated by the open basis  This topology makes it a locally convex topological space  and moreover a Fr√©chet space by  The identity map is continuous by construction  By taking the inductive limit  of locally convex spaces   we define a topology  denoted by on  It makes an LF-space in the sense of  The separateness can be seen from the fact that the convex subset in is open in the -topology for any and thus in the -topology  Let be a finitely generate -module  We denote the -module topology on  cf   nottop  by  Let us prove that the topology is separated  Let be a surjective homomorphism  and put  Consider the quotient topology on using the topology on  It suffices to show that is separated  Indeed  take such that  There exists an integer such that  If is separated  there exists such that  Since we get the claim  Let us show that is separated  Since is a noetherian complete -adic ring  cf     is also -adically complete  and in particular  -adically separated  Thus  it suffices to show that is separated for any using the quotient topology from  Consider the topology defined by the filtration by order on  The topology coincides with the quotient topology via induced by  Since is a noetherian complete filtered ring by we get that is separated  and thus the topology on is separated  This shows that  is a closed sub- -module  Thus the topological vector space is a Fr√©chet space  Of course  the identity map is continuous  We define the inductive limit topology  of locally convex spaces  on which is called the   natural topology  on  If the natural topology is separated  then is an LF-space  When it is separated  the open mapping theorem implies that coincides with the -module topology  In the same way  we define topologies and on and on finitely generated -modules when we are in Situation  L  of setup  Suppose we are in Situation   normalfont L   of   normalfontsetup    Let be a finitely generated -module  We assume that it is also finite as -module  Then the natural topology as -module and the natural topology as -module are equivalent  In particular  if moreover is a free -module  then the topologies are separated  and becomes an LF-space  Let us see the equivalence  Let be a surjection  This surjection induces the surjection and the quotient topology is defined  Let be the Fr√©chet topology defined using the surjection and the -module structure  as done above in topologyonring for  Since is a topological -module by the definition  the homomorphism defines a continuous surjective homomorphism of topological modules  By the open mapping theorem of Fr√©chet spaces  we see that this homomorphism is strict  which implies that and are equivalent  The first claim follows by taking the inductive limit over  When is free as a -module  then it is obvious that it is separated 
Relations between microlocalizations at different levels
 In this subsection  we investigate the behavior of microlocalizations when we raise levels  In general  this is very difficult  However  once we know that the supports of the microlocalizations are stable  cf   stabledef   the behavior is very simple at least in the case of a curve  Suppose we are in Situation   normalfont Ls   of   normalfontsetup    Let be non-negative integers  and be a left ideal of   we put  Let be the -module associated to  cf   Remark   normalfontsetup  i    on and assume  m rSupp   m sM     pi  -1  s  cap mathrin gT   X  Then for any integer there exists a positive integer and such that y s N- varpi R-S in I  Since is a noetherian ring  cf     there exist operators for such that is generated by  Let and be its special fiber  Then by the assumption on the support  there exists for each such that For we denote by the image of in and define  We put  Since for any there exists an integer such that where the overlines denote the images in or thus  This shows that there exists an integer such that for any we can write y s NQ i Q  i  varpi R i S i  where and  Then by  sumequ1qp   there exist and such that y s N  sum Q  i cdot P i  varpi R  S   Let us show that for any integer It is evident that the right hand side is included in the left one  let us prove the opposite inclusion  Take elements and such that  Write with and put and  Then we get and in particular contained in which is thanks to uniqueness of the expansion considered in def intermediate microdiff  By assumption we have which implies the equality  relationincl  Since we get  by using  relationincl   that  varpi R  S  in varpi Ecomp bm m    m sX     Ecomp bm m     ms X    k  Thus the lemma follows  Suppose we are in Situation   normalfont Ls   of   normalfontsetup    Let be non-negative integers  and be a globally finitely presented -module such that  m rSupp   m sM   cap mathrin gT   X  pi  -1  s  cap mathrin gT   X  We denote by  Then we have the following   i  The module is finite over  Moreover  if it is monogenic as an -module  there exists a -torsion free -module such that and is finitely generated over   ii  There exists a finite set of elements in such that for any open affine neighborhood of in is generated by these elements over  If is generated by then there exists an integer such that we can take this set to be  Let be a coherent sub- -module of  Let be either or  Then by the additivity of supports we know that  m rSupp   m sN    cap mathrin gT   X  pi  -1  s  cap mathrin gT   X mbo x or   ptyset  If it is then and in particular  is finite over  By induction on the number of generators of we reduce the verification of both  i  and  ii  to the monogenic case  From now on  we assume that is a monogenic module  Fix a generator  Let be the sub- -module of generated by  Let be the kernel of the homomorphism of left -modules sending to  We note that  by definition   Since is -torsion free  we get that where denotes the -module associated

Characteristic cycles and microlocalizations
 We will see how we can compute the multiplicities of holonomic modules from its microlocalizations  In general  it is very difficult to calculate the characteristic cycles in terms of intermediate microlocalizations  However  the construction of the rings of   naive  microdifferential operators are simple and formal  therefore we can calculate the multiplicities easier 

 For a graded ring and a finite graded -module the graded length of is the length of in the category of graded -modules  and we denote it by  When we say that is gr-simple  We say that is gr-Artinian if   gr-Artinian  gr-simple    Let be a positively graded commutative ring  and be a finite graded -module  Let and S   mf p     1  cup l f in A setminus A 0 mid mbo x is a homogeneous element which is not contained in   r   We denote by the localization and by  We note that since consists of homogeneous elements  these are respectively a graded ring and a graded module  Let  The schemes and are schemes over and there exists a canonical section  We put  Let us denote by the canonical surjection defined in  Now we get the following  Let be the quasi-coherent -module associated to  Let be a generic point of  Then we get  m rg lg   A   widetilde  mf p     M   widetilde  mf p       m rlg   A   mf p    M   mf p     By we get that the fiber of at is  Since the support of the sheaf in is contained in and there exists an integer such that  Thus is a graded -module  Let be a graded -module such that  Then by the definition of  This shows that given a chain of graded sub- -modules  we can attach a chain of sub- -modules  Thus we see that  To see the opposite inequality  it suffices to show that given a -module such that then  Since is the only gr-simple -module  it suffices to show that which is obvious 

 Let be a noetherian filtered ring  and be a finite -module  Let be a good filtration on  Then consider  Exactly as in the classical way  e g     we are able to show that this does not depend on the choice of good filtrations  Recall we say that an increasingly filtered ring is Zariskian if it is noetherian filtered and is contained in the Jacobson radical of  Let be a Zariskian filtered ring such that is a gr-Artinian ring  Suppose moreover that is finite and  m rlg  A A   m rg lg    mr gr  A    m rgr  A    Then for any good filtered -module we get  m rlg  A M   m rg lg    mr gr  A    m rgr  M    The field of formal Laurent series in is Zariskian filtered by the filtration given by the degree in  We have that is gr-Artinian  of graded length and  First  let be a good filtered -module and take a sequence of sub- -modules M supsetneq M   1   supsetneq ots supsetneq M   l   0  We equip with the induced filtration  These filtrations are good by since is a Zariskian filtered ring  Since the filtration on is good and is a Zariskian filtered ring  the filtration is separated  and  Thus we get the strictly decreasing sequence  m rgr  M  supsetneq m rgr  M   1    supsetneq ots supsetneq  m rgr  M   l    0  This shows that  It suffices to show that if is a good filtered -module such that is a simple -module  then is a gr-simple -module  Let A  I   0   supsetneq I   1   supsetneq ots supsetneq I   l   0 be a composition series  The hypothesis and the above observation imply that  m rgr  A  supsetneq m rgr  I   1    supsetneq ots supsetneq  m rgr  I   l    0 is also a composition series in the category of graded modules  Since any simple graded -module is appearing in the series  we get that for any simple -module there exists a good filtration on such that the -module is gr-simple  Indeed  there exists such that  We put the good filtration induced by that of on  Then since is a gr-simple -module  we get the claim  Since for any good filtrations and on we know that and have the same gr-length  we get that is gr-simple for any good filtration  This concludes the proof of the lemma

 We summarize what we have got  and get the following characteristic cycle version of Theorem mainabe which is one of main theorems of this paper  Recall the notation of paragraph localsetting   Stability theorem for curves  Let be an affine formal curve over in Situation   normalfont L   of   normalfontsetup    and be a stable holonomic -module  Let be the set of singular points of and suppose that is a convergent isocrystal  Let be the generic rank of   i  For any we get  m rrk    CK  ms X    tial    m    l  Ecomp Qm  s    m sM   r    m rrk    CK  ms X    tial    m  m      l   Ecomp Qm  m    s   m sM   r    m rrk    CK  ms X    tial    m     l   Ecomp Qm   s   m sM   r   This number is denoted by   ii  For any we get  m rCycl    m     Dcomp Qm    m sX   otimes   DcompQ m   m sX     m sM   r cdot X  p  m     K  m sX   K  cdot sum  s in S  eg s   -1  cdot r s  cdot  pi  -1  s    Since is stable  we get for any  m rrk   Ecomp Qm    s   m sM     m rrk   Ecomp Qm  m    s    m sM     m rrk   Ecomp Qm   s   m sM    by Proposition rankcompat  Thus  i  follows  Let us see  ii   For this  the vertical multiplicities are the only problem  By Proposition levmcharcycle we get for any p  m   cdot m rrk    CK  ms X    tial    m       Ecomp Qm   s   m sM     m rdeg  s  cdot K  m sX   K   -1  cdot m s  m sM    m      Thus combining with  i   we get  ii   Thanks to Theorem stabilitytheoremcy we can now define the characteristic cycle of holonomic -modules  cf   defCycl and prove Corollary cor noeth art  These were already know for the category of holonomic - -modules  cf    The main point is to give  for a -module a definition of the characteristic cycle independent on the level  i e    independent on the choice of a -module such that  In loc   cit  Berthelot used his Frobenius descent theorem  whereas here we can take  thanks to Theorem stabilitytheoremcy an integer big enough  so that is stable    characteristic variety and cycle Cycl  |   Let be a formal curve  and let be a holonomic -module  Let is a stable coherent -module such that  Let be the set of singular points of  We define  m rCycl   m sM   r cdot X   K  m sX   K  cdot sum  s in S   m rdeg  s   -1  cdot r s cdot  pi  -1  s    where is the generic rank of and which do not depend on the choice of by Theorem stabilitytheoremcy   i  When possesses a Frobenius structure  the characteristic cycle here coincides with that of Berthelot  or   ii  By Theorem stabilitytheoremcy - ii  and  Sdef cycl Dm is additive on short exact sequences of holonomic -modules   iii  The characteristic cycle has integral coefficients  To prove this we may first assume geometrically connected  indeed does not change if we consider as a smooth formal scheme over   secondly we note that if we base change by a finite extension  then the multiplicities will not change  by construction   therefore we may assume rational over and the integrality of is evident  Let be a formal curve over  The category of holonomic -modules is both noetherian and artinian  The argument of the proof is the same as that of  We recall it for the convenience of the reader  We can prove the ascending chain condition as follows  let be an ascending filtration by holonomic sub-modules  We may assume  The support of has dimension one because is holonomic  By additivity of cf   Remark defCycl - ii   we have  for all Since is a noetherian space and the coefficients  and  appearing in belong to we get  for big enough    therefore  We can prove the descending chain condition in a similar way 
Local Fourier transform
 The aim of this section is to define the local Fourier transform  We note that the definition itself is not difficult anymore thanks to works of Huyghe and Matsuda  we can take the canonical extension  the geometric Fourier transform  and take the differential module around as presented in  However  with this definition  we are not able to prove the stationary phase formula in the way used in the complex case  In this section  we instead define the local Fourier transform using microlocalizations following the classical techniques  and prove some basic properties 
Local theory of arithmetic -modules
 Since the main goal of this paper  Theorem Product formula  is to prove a theorem connecting local and global invariants  it is indispensable to work in local situations  In the -adic case  this was the theory of √©tale sheaves on traits  in other words Galois representations of local fields  In our setting  the theory of arithmetic -modules on a formal disk by Crew Cr3 Cr which can be seen as a generalization of the theory of solvable -adic differential equations  should be the corresponding theory  We briefly review the theory in this subsection 

 Let be as usual  cf   defRmsX   we recall that denotes a uniformizer of  The field will be assumed perfect in all  Ssection2 with exception of Crewconstan -- diffmoddef and analye  Denote by    miscellaneous W    a Cohen ring with residue field  ring of Witt vectors if is perfect   For any commutative local ring we will denote by  or  its maximal ideal  If is an -adic ring  for an ideal of we will denote it by when we want to specify the ideal of definition explicitly  Let be a -dimensional formally smooth local noetherian -algebra complete with respect to the -adic topology  such that whose residue field is finite over  In this situation  is complete with respect to the -adic topology by  Let and     miscellaneous K    Note that is a discrete valuation ring  Now we get the following  The -algebra is isomorphic to  By we get  Moreover  the ring is a complete noetherian local ring  formally smooth over such that its reduction over is isomorphic to  Thus by we get the lemma  The situation we have in mind is the following  the -algebra is the completion of the local ring of a formal curve at a closed point with respect to the filtration by the powers of its maximal ideal  denoted by  In this case we will put and denotes by the field of fractions of     miscellaneous Ox2    We simply denote by  The formal scheme    miscellaneous S    is called a   formal disk   formal disk  and it consists of two points  an open point and a closed point  We put which consists of only one point  Note that Crew in Cr used the notation for     miscellaneous S    The reason why we introduced and will be clarified in Remark Rem on S tilde

 In Cr3 Cr Crew checked that on the theory of arithmetic -modules can be constructed in the same manner  He constructed the ring  resp    of Berthelot differential operators  resp   overconvergent at   cf     differential operators D    He also constructed analytic variants and  differential operators Dan  |   of these rings by   analytifying   and where  Here analytification roughly means to tensor with and take the completion with respect to a suitable topology  Let us briefly review the constructions of  Choose an isomorphism by Lemma existconcdesc  For a positive integer and a non-negative integer we define    miscellaneous Ori    to be as defined in  When is divided by possesses a -module structure  cf    We define a   ring    Dcomp Qm  x     mr an     invlim  n  l   invlim i  m cO   np  m 1  i  otimes   mc O   X i   Dmo dm  X i    otimes m bQ  r   Although it is not defined explicitly in   loc   cit    this ring is used to define as inductive limit of over   differential operators Dan  |   By the remark below this ring depends only on and not on the parameter used to define it  so we denote it by  The construction of is analogous  by using in place of  In the construction of the rings and one uses the parameter  Thus    shape a priori  the construction depends on this choice  However  if we use another such that its image in is a uniformizer to construct the rings  the resulting rings are canonically isomorphic to those constructed using the uniformizer  Indeed  using the notation of let be the ring using the uniformizer  Let be another uniformizer  Then there exists a canonical isomorphism  Moreover  in there exists an inclusion and  Thus the claim follows from the definition of and  Moreover Crew generalize these constructions to define analytification functors  cf    -    mr an   colon m rCoh   Ddag Q widetilde  ms S     arrow  m rMod   Da n widetilde  ms S    m bQ      qquad  -    mr an   colon m rCoh   Ddag Q widetilde  ms S    0   arrow  m rMod   Da n widetilde  ms S    m bQ   0     functors  1    where denotes the category of coherent modules and denotes the category of modules  They send to and to respectively  and for every coherent -module  resp   -module  there exists a natural monomorphism  Finally  the morphisms and are flat  both left and right   the analytification functors are exact  and we have  resp     for any coherent -module  resp   -module  cf    We define the sheaves  differential operators Ddag    by  Gamma  m sS   Ddag Q ms S   	    Ddag Q widetilde  ms S    	 qquad  Gamma  eta   ms S     Ddag Q ms S   	    Ddag Q widetilde  ms S    0

 Put define the bounded Robba ring  in fact a field  by and the Robba ring by  Robba s rings  1     cf   fieldconstmicdif  By Remark rem indipendec par the rings and depend on the choice of the coordinate of only up to a canonical isomorphism  indeed they are the sub-rings of order zero differential operators in and respectively  we denote these rings by and  We often omit the subscripts and write simply and   rings of analytical functions    Let us fix our conventions on the definition of differential modules   differential module  In this paper  we will adopt the definition of Kedlaya  Namely  we define a differential -module to be a locally free sheaf of finite rank on the rigid analytic annulus over with a connection  In other words  it is a collection where is a finite differential -module equipped with isomorphisms for of differential modules  compatible with each other in the obvious sense  Let us define the category of differential -modules  An object consists of a differential -modules for some  Let be a differential -module  and be a differential -module where  Then we define the set of homomorphisms by  m rHom    mc C    M   N     indlim  s arrow 1 -   m rHom    tial  l  m cA  the natural map is an isomorphism for any and the functor of global sections is an equivalence on its essential image   loc   cit   Cor   3 3   Let be a differential -module which is defined by a differential -module also denoted by  We define  Gamma  M     indlim  s arrow1 -  Gamma l  m cA  this defines a homomorphism inducing  Taking the inductive limit  we get what we want  For any differential ideal of we can define a differential -module by  However is not equal to in general  For example take a differential ideal of of infinite type  cf    Since is differentially simple  cf     loc   cit   Rem   3 1    the ideal is equal to and the differential module is free of rank

 Starting from here  with the exception of analye we assume that is perfect  Let be a lifting of the -th absolute Frobenius morphism     miscellaneous sigma    An - -module  resp   - -module  is a -module  resp   -module  endowed with an isomorphism  For - -modules the definition of holonomy is the same than that for formal smooth schemes  cf    An - -module  resp   - -module  is said holonomic if there exists a holonomic  holonomic  - -module  - -module  - -module such that cf        We denote by -  resp   - resp   -  the category of holonomic - -modules  resp   holonomic - -modules  resp  the category of differential module on with Frobenius structure    categories FHol  - - -   The category of free differential -modules with Frobenius structure is equivalent to the category of holonomic - -modules  By we get that given a free differential -module with Frobenius structure  there exists a free differential -module with Frobenius structure such that  Thus  by can be viewed as a holonomic -module  By construction this induces the equivalence of categories  The scalar extension defines a functor denoted by from the category of holonomic - -modules to -  Let and be formal disks  If we are given a finite √©tale morphism this induces a functor and also the pull-back  In the same way  if we are given a finite √©tale morphism of generic points this defines a functor and the pull-back and the same for etc  We note here that consists of a single point  There is no problem as long as we only consider finite √©tale morphisms of like above  but in this paper  we need to use push-forwards and pull-backs in the situation where only morphisms on like are defined  Under this situation  adding the generic point by considering instead of makes descriptions much simpler 

 Let us anticipate here some definitions for - -modules on a formal disk  that are used in rest of this section  for more details cf   or defvanishcycle  For any -module we put    functors six operations j    conversely for any -module we define the -module obtained from by restriction of scalars via   functors six operations j    Similar definitions hold for -modules and -modules  The - -module  punctual  type  the - -module   is by definition the holonomic - -module elta   Ddag Q widetilde  ms S     Ddag Q widetilde  ms S     cdot t  m cR  b  m cO    ms S   m bQ    Rob  m cO    mr an    By construction is holonomic and  We say that a -module is punctual  or punctual type   punctual  type   if there exists a finite dimensional -vector space such that   functors six operations i    By construction a punctual - -module is automatically holonomic  We say that a -module is connection type  connection type  if there exists a -module such that  For connection type - -modules holonomicity is equivalent to coherence  and if is a coherent - -module  then is connection type if and only if the natural map of -modules is an isomorphism  We have similar definitions of punctual and connection type hold for -modules 

 Let us recall more notation and definitions from Cr see   loc   cit    S1  for details  The bounded Robba ring is a discrete valuation field with respect to the 1-Gauss norm  Let us denote by  Robba s rings  2  |   its integer ring and by its residue field  where is the class of  Choose a separable closure    miscellaneous K     We set and let    miscellaneous G    be the inertia subgroup  Since is henselian  given a finite separable extension of there exists a unique finite unramified extension  Robba s rings  2  |   of whose residue field  of its integer ring  is  Put  Let be a positive integer  and we put  We fix a lifting of -th Frobenius of on which induces the Frobenius homomorphism on and also denoted by  This extends canonically to  Now  we put  padic  -adic hyperfunctions and microfunctions  |   where runs through finite separable extensions of inside  Then this ring is naturally equipped with a -action  and a Frobenius homomorphism  We formally add       to get the ring of hyperfunctions  we define  The action of extends canonically to   so does   and we also have the monodromy operator  which is the derivation by   cf     loc   cit    S1 4   We put  In he defined to be but this should be a typo   where denotes the maximal unramified field extension of and is cf   diffmoddef   rings of analytical functions      Crew defined an -module by  padic  -adic hyperfunctions and microfunctions  |   cf    loc   cit    6 1 1    The action of the endomorphism and the nilpotent operator induce  by quotient  analogous structures on  We denote by the canonical projection  By definition  the derivation factors through and we get  These homomorphisms satisfy the relations and cf     loc   cit    S6 1    padic  -adic hyperfunctions and microfunctions 

 Let  categories Del    denote the category of Deligne  Deligne module  modules   This terminology was first introduced by Fontaine in  These are also called -modules  and this terminology is used more widely  especially in -adic Hodge theory  However  in our context  we believe that   Deligne module   is more suitable      shape i e    finite dimensional -vector spaces  endowed with a semi-linear action of  which acts on the constants via its residual action   a Frobenius isomorphism and a mo -no -dromy operator satisfying where in notationofCrint  See for more details  In the following  for simplicity  we denote by   differential operators Dan    Crew classifies holonomic - -modules in terms of linear data  cf    To do this  let be a holonomic - -module  He defined in   loc   cit     m bV   M     m rHom    ms D    mr an     M   m cB    qquad  m bW   M     m rHom    ms D    mr an     M   m cC     functors  V    These are Deligne modules  and define  contravariant  functors  There are the canonical homomorphism induced by and the variation homomorphism induced by  These satisfy many compatibilities  they are endowed with an extra structure  the   Galois variation    which we do not recall here   These kind of objects are called Solution data they form an artinian category  denoted  categories S    and we have an exact functor -   for the details see   loc   cit   The main point is that we can retrieve the original module from these linear data  indeed Crew constructs a quasi-inverse functor - factorizing through the category of holonomic - -modules  cf      loc   cit   7 1    functors  S    We can characterize some properties of in terms of these linear data  For example is connection type if and only if the canonical map is an isomorphism  cf    The most important property for us is the existence of the following exact sequence of Deligne modules  cf      loc   cit    Cor  6 1 1  Lemma 6 1 2    	0 arrow m rHom    ms D    mr an     M   m cO    mr an     K   mr ur     arrow m bV   M   arrow m bW   M   arrow m rExt  1   ms D    mr an     M   m cO   K   mr ur       mr an    arrow 0

 Let us recall the canonical extension  which is one of key tools in this paper  For the detailed argument  one can refer to  Let and     miscellaneous P    Then there exists a functor F mbo x-  m rHol   m sS  0  arrow F mbo x-  m rHol   Ddag Q Pone   infty    qquad  M  mapst oM    mathrm can   notag  functors  2    where - denotes the category of holonomic - -modules  By construction  this functor is fully faithful  exact  and it commutes with tensor products and duals  Moreover  we have the following properties  cf   loc   cit   Th   8 2 1 and paragraph after its proof   1   is a   special   convergent isocrystal  2     3   regular at  for the definition of regularity cf   def regularity  This is called the canonical extension of  By these properties  we remind that when is a free differential module  coincides with the canonical extension of Matsuda in and in this case  it sends unit-root objects to unit-root objects 

 In characterisation of Dan0 hol mod we have characterized holonomic - -modules  Let us conclude this subsection with a lemma characterizing holonomic - -modules  Let be an - -module  Assume that is a free differential -module  and the kernel and cokernel of the canonical homomorphism are punctual -modules  Then is a holonomic - -module  In particular  if there exists a holonomic - -module such that as -modules   without Frobenius structures   then is a holonomic - -module  We denote by the full subcategory of the category of -modules with Frobenius structure consisting of objects considered in the statement of the lemma  We define functors and in the same way as or especially    loc   cit     6 1 9    cf   also mainresultscrewrev  We first claim that and are exact functors  To see this  consider the following exact sequences 0 arrow  N  1 arrow  M  arrow  M   arrow 0

Analytification
 In  Ssecdefforloc we will define a local Fourier transform  The local Fourier transform should be local not only in the scheme theoretic sense  but also   rigid analytically    In this subsection  we will prove a crucial tool  cf   Proposition analytifcisom  which is indispensable to prove such properties 

 In this subsection  we do not assume to be perfect  Let be a formal curve  and take a closed point in  Choose an isomorphism where cf   existconcdesc  We will define a ring  microdifferential operators analytic  |   in the following way  Let us use the notation of Cr recall1  To construct the analytification of we follow exactly the same way as in Abe   there are several steps  For the first step  we take the microlocalization of with respect to the filtration by order  cf    and denote it by  Second step  take the inverse limit over namely and denote it by  We put and we take the inverse limit over to define  Now  for an integer we want to define the analytification of  Also for this  we follow the same way as   loc   cit   Put  Let be either or  Then we define to be the subring of consisting of the finite order operators  Then we may prove in the same way as   loc   cit    that there exists a canonical homomorphism  psi  m m   colon Emo dm   nc x  otimes m bQ  arrow Emo dm  nc x   otimes m bQ   We define to be the -adic completion of  This ring is noetherian by the same argument as  We define  Finally we define   Ecomp Qm m   x     mr an     invlim  n  Ecom pm m    nc x  mb Q    Obviously  there exists the canonical inclusion  In the same way as for we define   Emo dm  ag  x  m bQ      mr an     invlim k   Ecomp Qm m k  x      mr an    qquad m sE   x  mb Q     mr an     indlim m   m sE     m  ag    x  mb Q      mr an    We point out that the rings does not depend on the choice of the isomorphism  cf   Remark Crewconstan  As an example  we have the following explicit description whose verification is left to the reader  We recall  cf   fieldconstmicdif that  for denotes the -Gauss norm on we have   Ecomp Qm m   x     mr an      sum  k<0 a k tial    angles m   k    sum  k q0 b k tial   angles m  k    Bigg arrowvert bo x7 5cm   and for any there exists such that for any and       microdifferential operators analytic  |   At last  let us fix a few notation  Let be a coherent -module  Let and be one of  We denote by or  This notation goes together with Notation setup

 We put a topologies for and on in exactly the same way as in topologyonring  Precisely  we put and we define a topology on as the topology generated by as a base of neighborhoods of zero  The topology on is the locally convex topology generated by as a base of neighborhoods of zero  and is the inductive limit topology  We get that is dense in where the intersection is taken in  Indeed putting the intersection is dense in  In the same way as topologyonring for any finitely generated -module  the -module topology is separated  Suppose we are in Situation   normalfont Ls   of   normalfontsetup    Moreover  we assume  Let be non-negative integers  and be a holonomic -module  not necessarily stable   We assume that  m rSupp   Ecomp Qm m  1   m sX   otimes   DcompQ m   m sX

the target of the homomorphism is also and we get the lemma  Thus we may assume that  First  we will see that the source of the homomorphism has an -module structure for some integer  For this  let us start by remarking that is monogenic  Indeed  since is affine  the -th relative Frobenius homomorphism can be lifted  Let us denote this lifting by and  Let the -module be the Frobenius descent of  cf    Then by there exists a surjection  Apply to both sides  By composing with the canonical surjection we get a surjective morphism  Denote by the induced isomorphism  and put  By Lemma lemmaexspope there exist and a positive integer such that  Since the order of is less than there exists such that and we get that where  By increasing the integer we may assume that is divisible by  For any element in we get  Thus for any operator we also get  This implies that for any integer there exists such that Let be the absolute ramification index of and take which is divisible by  Let  We claim the following  For any sequence in which converges to seen as a sequence in the sequence in converges to using the -module topology  In particular the sequence converges to using the natural topology which makes the module an LF-space by Lemma topology and Lemma finiteness  Let us admit this claim first  and see that there exists a canonical -module structure on  For we may write with and the sequence converges to in  Then the claim says that converges to in  So we may define by and we get the action of on since the latter space is separated  Let us verify the claim  By  divreseachn  and

Ecomp bm m    m sX     EcompQ bm m    m sX   cdot I   where  Summing up  there exists an increasing sequence of integers such that if then  We can find a sequence of integers such that the sequence is strictly decreasing  Back to the claim  for any integer there exists such that for any  Then  we have and we get the claim  There are two natural homomorphisms  alpha colon EcompQ bm m    m sX

inclusion and is defined by extending linearly the canonical homomorphism using the -module structure on defined above  We can check easily that  Thus is injective  Let us see that is surjective  It suffices to show that is a homomorphism of -modules  Take an element  It suffices to show that for any  By density  cf   deftopoean   there exists an integer such that is contained in the closure of

the source of is equivalent to the -module topology  Since is -linear  it is continuous  Since the target of is separated  we get that  compatidisp  holds by the continuity of  We conclude that is an isomorphism  Let us finish the proof  It suffices to see that is an isomorphism where  When is a finite projective -module  the equality is obvious  By the same argument as Lemma flatness is flat over for any positive integer  Since is of finite homological dimension  there is a finite projective resolution whose length is by   If fact we can take to be   We have the following diagram where the

 Let be a formal curve over  Let be a stable holonomic -module  and let be a singular point of  Then by the Proposition analytifcisom for any integers the module  cf   localsetting  possesses a canonical -module structure  and in particular  we get a canonical homomorphism  psi colon  Dcomp Qm   s     mr an   otimes m sM  arrow Ecomp Qm  m    s  otimes m sM   Taking the inductive limit over we get a canonical homomorphism  m sM |  S s  arrow Edag Qs  otimes m sM   By an abuse of language  we sometimes denote the image of where is either or by  Let be an open affine neighborhood of such that there exists a local parameter at and is the unique singularity of in  Then by the proposition  we get  Now we define topologies as follows   i  We equip with the natural topology as an -module which makes it an LF-space by Lemma topology and Lemma finiteness  Note that this topology does not depend on the choice of by the same lemma   ii  We equip with the projective limit topology of the projective system of Banach spaces  This makes a Fr√©chet space   i  The topology on is also equivalent to the -module topology by Lemma topology   ii  The homomorphism is continuous by the claim in the proof of Proposition analytifcisom  In particular  if a sequence converges to in we get that converges to in

 The following corollary of Proposition analytifcisom plays an important role when we prove a fundamental properties of local Fourier transforms  cf   Lemma nongeometpt and locFourrel  Let and be two formal curves  and take points and  Assume that there exists an isomorphism of formal disks over   i  Let and be holonomic and -module respectively  and assume that  iota   l   Dcomp Qm  x     mr an   otimes m sM  r   xrightarro w sim   Dcomp Qm  x      mr an   otimes m sM   as -modules  Then there exists canonical isomorphisms  iota   l  Ecomp Qm m   x  otimes m sM  r  cong  Ecomp Qm m   x   otimes m sM    qquad  iota   l  Emo dm  ag  x  m bQ   otimes m sM  r   cong Emo dm  ag  x   m bQ    otimes m sM   for   ii  Let and be holonomic and -module respectively  and assume that  iota   m sM |  S x  cong m sM  |  S  x    as -modules  Then there exists a canonical isomorphism  First  let us prove  i   We get 	 iota   Ecomp Qm m   x  otimes m sM   xrightarrow       sim  iota    Ecomp Qm m   x      mr an   otimes m sM  xleftarro w sim  iota     Ecomp Qm m   x     mr an   otimes   Dcomp Qm   m sX      mr an    otimes m sM

Equality between two definitions of irregularity 
 Another important corollary of Proposition analytifcisom is a comparison result of multiplicities of characteristic cycles  irregularity of Garnier  and irregularity of Christol-Mebkhout  cf   Corollary compCMGAR

 Let us review the definitions first  We assume that is perfect and that there exists a lifting of -th absolute Frobenius  Let be a solvable differential -module  cf   or  By a result of Christol and Mebkhout  cf   for free differential modules  or in general  there exists a canonical decomposition where is a differential -module purely of differential slope  slope differential slope   The irregularity of is defined by   irregularity |   We say that is regular  differential module  regular free differential module  if or equivalently  Let be a formal curve over and be a closed subset of such that its complement is dense in  Let be a convergent isocrystal on overconvergent along  For in we define the irregularity of Christol-Mebkhout  m rirr    mr CM   x  m sM     m rirr   m sM |   eta x    when we say that is regular at or that is a regular singularity for   Fi  -isocrystal  overconvergent isocrystal  regular singular point of  We also have the irregularity of Garnier  For simplicity  we assume moreover that possesses a Frobenius structure  Let us denote by the underlying -module of which is   a priori  a coherent -module  This is a holonomic module  and Garnier defined  In   loc   cit    he defined only in the case where is a -rational point  but we do not think we need this assumption here  In   loc   cit    is denoted by    for in  m rirr    mr Gar   x  m sM     chi l R shom   DdagQ  ms X     j   m sM    m cO    ms X   m bQ  |  S x  	  r  - m   xi x 0  j   m sM  -m x j   m sM      irregularity |   where  resp    denotes the vertical multiplicity at  resp   the generic rank  of cf   def cycl Dm and defCycl  Since is an isocrystal we have cf    The finiteness of was not known at the time Garnier defined the irregularity  now  using some results of Crew  based on the local monodromy theorem  this finiteness is easy  and this is also proven in the next corollary 

 The following corollary has already been announced  See A  Marmora    About p-adic Local Fourier Transform   Poster 2 at Journ√©es de G√©om√©trie Arithm√©tique de Rennes  available at   http   perso univ-rennes1 fr ahmed abbes Conference posters html    by the second author using a local computation  which is different from our method here  Let be a convergent -isocrystal on overconvergent along  Then we have Moreover  we have First of all  let us show the equality  garinv0  The ring has a canonical -module structure and identifies with cf   preisouadsf   let us denote it simply by  Let be a   flat  homomorphism of sheaves of rings on a topological space  For and we have  Using this  we have R n shom   DdagQ  ms X    j   m sM   m cO    ms X   m bQ  |  S x    cong R n shom   DdagQ  ms S  x     Ddag Q ms S  x  otimes j   m sM   m cO    mr an

Definition of local Fourier transform
 In this subsection  we define the local Fourier transform  We only define the so called -local Fourier transforms  In a later section  we will define an analog of -local Fourier transform in very special cases  and we do not deal with -local Fourier transform in this paper 

 Let us fix a situation under which we use the Fourier transforms  Let be a positive integer  and put  We assume that the residue field of is perfect  We moreover assume that the absolute -th Frobenius automorphism of lifts to an automorphism  We assume that the field contains a root of the equation  so that it contains all of them      miscellaneous pi  Dwork s  The Dwork exponential series in has a radius of convergence strictly greater than and it converges for to a -th root of unity  The choice of determines a non-trivial additive character    miscellaneous psi    by sending to  Conversely if is a non-trivial additive character  then is a -th root of unity in and the polynomial splits completely in  There exists a unique root of such that modulo and then we have  For the details see  We denote by  resp    the affine  resp   projective     miscellaneous A  |      miscellaneous P       miscellaneous P  |   line over with the fixed coordinate and we denote by  resp    its dual line  To lighten the notation we often put and     miscellaneous A  |   We denote by and  or and if we want to clarify the coordinates  the differential operators corresponding to and   differential operators delta    We denote by  resp    the point at infinity of  resp    Let and     miscellaneous P  |   To summarize notation once and for all  we use terminologies of the next section  and consider the following diagram of   couples   where and are the projections  These morphisms are not used till the next section  If we take to be  resp     we are in Situation  L  of setup using the fixed coordinate  We use freely the notation of setup especially  For a smooth formal scheme over we put  We denote by  resp    the coordinate of  resp    induced by  resp    The relative Frobenius of lifts to the morphism sending to  We have a similar morphism for and denote it by
 Let us introduce some notation for a formal disk around a closed point of  We put    miscellaneous S    and     miscellaneous S    We denote and by and respectively  Let be a finite unramified extension of and the ring of integers of  We put and denote by  Let be a closed point of the maximal ideal of associated to  We denote by the monic generator of and by a lifting of in which is a local parameter of at cf   coordinates   we denote also by its image in the completion of the local ring of at  We define    miscellaneous tau  |   by sending to  We note that if we take another lifting then there exists a canonical equivalence of functors and since and are congruent modulo  We denote and by and respectively  For let be the closed point of defined by  Let be the residue field of be the unique finite √©tale extension of corresponding to namely and be its field of fractions  Let be the closed point of defined by and  The rational point corresponds to an element of also denoted by and take a lifting of in  We have the homomorphism sending to  The functors and do not depend on the choice of up to a canonical equivalence  We denote and by and respectively  By the √©taleness of over there is a canonical inclusion  We define by sending to  Also in this case  and do not depend on the choice of up to a canonical equivalence and we denote them by and respectively  Let be the finite √©tale morphism induced by sending to  Summing up  we defined the following morphisms   vcente r  xymatrix R 20pt C 30pt   widehat  mb A   1  R s  	  m sS    widetilde s    ar drrr  <>  8   sigma   widetilde  mf s     	  	  m sS   K s  ar d    iota

Complements to cohomological operations
 In this section  we review some known results of six functors which are indispensable in this paper  and give complements to properties of geometric Fourier transforms defined by Noot-Huyghe  The proofs for the properties of geometric Fourier transforms are almost the same as that of Lau so we content ourselves by pointing out the differences 
Cohomological operations
 In this section  we assume to be perfect  Let be an integer  and we put    miscellaneous hq    as usual  We assume that there exists an automorphism    miscellaneous sigma    which is a lifting of the absolute -th Frobenius on  Let be a smooth formal scheme over  We define by the following cartesian diagram   xymatri x  ms X   ar r  ar d  ar    rd  | square  	 m sX  ar d

 To fix notation  let us review the theory of arithmetic -modules concerning this paper  We say that is a d-couple  d-couple  if is a smooth formal scheme and is a divisor of its special fiber  Here  can be empty  Let be another d-couple  A morphism of d-couples is a morphism such that and is a divisor  The morphism is called the realization of and if it is unlikely to be confused  we often denote by  Let be a property of morphisms  We say that the morphism of d-couples satisfies the property if satisfies the property  Let be a smooth formal scheme over be its special fiber  and be its Raynaud generic fiber  Then we have the specialization map of topoi  Recall that  we say that a -module is a convergent  - isocrystal if is a convergent  - isocrystal  and the same for overconvergent  - isocrystals  cf   conventionocisoc  Let be a d-couple  and we denote by the dual functor with respect to -modules  If it is unlikely to cause any confusion  we often denote this by   functors six operations D    Let be a morphism of d-couples  We have the extraordinary pull-back functor from the category of coherent -modules to that of -modules  cf    Let be a bounded coherent  -  -complex  When is coherent  we define  functors six operations f  |  to be  Suppose in turn that is a bounded coherent  -  -complex  In this case  we put f   m sM    l  m bD    ms X  Z  circ f   circ  m bD    ms Y  W  r    m sM     functors six operations f  |   Now  suppose that the morphism of d-couples is a proper morphism  We have the push-forward functor from the category of coherent -modules to that of coherent -modules  Let be a  -  -module  Suppose is coherent as a -module  Then we denote by  functors six operations j    this coherent module  We define  functors six operations f  |   to be the coherent -module  Assume in turn that is coherent as a -module  We define f   m sN    l  m bD    ms Y  W  circ f   circ m bD    ms X  Z  r    m sN     functors six operations f  |   When we are given and in  categories LD     cf   for the notation when is empty  but the construction is the same   we denote the object in by   functors six operations t  |

 In this paragraph  let us see the relation between the rigid cohomology and the push-forward of arithmetic -modules  Let be a   proper  smooth formal scheme of dimension  Let be a divisor of the special fiber of be the complement  and be its special fiber  We denote by the specialization map where denotes the Raynaud generic fiber of  Let be the structural morphism  Let be a coherent -module which is overconvergent along  Suppose that it is coherent as a -module  In prop6func we noted that  For an isocrystal we denote by the dual as isocrystal  This isomorphism leads us to the following comparison of dual functors  cf     We get the following relation with the rigid cohomology  where  For the details of the proof  see  To see the relation for cohomologies with compact support  we use the Poincar√© duality of rigid cohomology to get For the detailed account  one can refer to  When is a curve  and for a holonomic -module we get that the following pairing is perfect  This can be seen from

 For the later use  we review the cohomological functors and in the theory of formal disks  Let be the formal disk over  For an object in - is by definition  functors six operations j    the underlying - -module  For an object in - we denote in - by  We denote by the closed immersion  The definitions of the functors are essentially the  functors six operations i  |    functors six operations i    same as in the global case  and are used frequently in Cr so for the details see    loc   cit   3 4    etc     Now  we denote by  resp    the dual  functors six operations D    functor with respect to  resp    These define functors from -  resp   -  to itself by  For an object in - we define  functors six operations j    and for an object in - we put where denotes the  functors six operations i  |    functors  4    dual of - -vector spaces  By using facts of prop6func we get isomorphisms and  By using these isomorphisms  the localization triangle induces the following distinguished triangle  For a holonomic - -module we put and and call them the nearby cycles and the vanishing cycles respectively  These define functors  Psi  Phi colon F mbo x-  m rHol   Da n ms S   m bQ    arrow De l Ct nr  G   mc K      functors  Psi    We note here that when is a free differential module on with Frobenius structure  we get where denotes the dual as a -module by  carodualfrob  For example  On the other hand  if is of punctual type such that where is a -vector space with Frobenius structure  we get that  Let be an object of -  Then we get the following exact sequence  0 arrow  M    tial 0  1  otimes K elta arrow j   M  arrow j   M  arrow  M   tial  M  1  otimes K elta arrow0  Since we get by  We also get  Thus   vanishexact  induces the following exact sequence  0 arrow m rHom    ms D    mr an     m bD  j   M     m cO    mr an    K   mr ur     arrow Phi j     M   arrow Phi j     M   arrow m rExt  1   ms D    mr an      m bD  j   M    m cO    mr an    K   mr ur     arrow0  We get isomorphisms R m rHom    ms D    mr an     m bD    ms S   j   M     m cO    mr an    cong R m rHom    ms D    mr an     m cO    mr an   -1  j   M   cong R m rHom    ms D    mr an   0    m cR   M   1   Here the first isomorphism follows from the fact that gives an anti-equivalence of categories combined with the isomorphism and the second by adjoint  Thus the lemma follows  We note that the dimension of and over are the same by the index theorem of Christol-Mebkhout
Geometric Fourier transforms
 We briefly review the definition of geometric Fourier transform due to Noot-Huyghe NH  For simplicity  we only review under the situation of setupFour  To define Fourier transforms  we need to define an integral kernel of the transform   Fi  -isocrystal  overconvergent isocrystal  Dwork s|   We define a convergent -isocrystal on overconvergent along denoted by in the following way  Let be the coordinate  As an -module  it is  We denote the element corresponding to by  We define its connection by  nabla e  - pi e otimes dt  This module is equipped with Frobenius structure  The Frobenius structure is defined by  Phi 1 otimes e    exp  pi t-t q  e   Fi  -isocrystal  overconvergent isocrystal  Dwork s|   Now  let us consider the situation in setupFour  There exists the canonical coupling sending to     miscellaneous mu  canonical coupling  By the general theory of overconvergent -isocrystals  the pull-back is a convergent -isocrystal on overconvergent along in  This is a coherent -module  and its restriction to is nothing but  By abuse of language  we denote this -module by or sometimes by  In the same way  there exists a unique coherent complex of -modules whose restriction to is  We also denote this by

 Now  let us recall the definition of the geometric Fourier transform  We continuously use the notation of setupFour  Recall the diagram  fourierdiagtwo  Let be a coherent -module  Noot-Huyghe defined the geometric Fourier transform of to be  m sF    pi   m sM  	  p     m sL    pi  mu  otimes   mc O     Poneoned  mb Q    infty     mb L   p   m sM  -2

 Let be a closed point of  Let be the residue field and be the corresponding unramified extension of its valuation ring  Then there exists a closed immersion sending to  We define   Fi  -isocrystal  overconvergent isocrystal  Dwork s  In the same way  given a closed point in we define on  When is a rational point  we can check that where is the Dwork differential module locASdiffmod on

 Finally  let us review a fundamental property of Fourier transform shown by Noot-Huyghe  There exists an isomorphism of rings  iota colon Gamma  Poned  Ddag Q Poned   infty    xrightarro w sim   Gamma  Pone  Ddag Q Pone   infty   sending to and to  It is also shown by Huyghe that coherent -modules corresponds to -modules by taking global sections  Given a coherent -module we denote by  functors naive  global  Fourier transform  |   the coherent -module obtained from via transport of structure by  For we denote by the corresponding element of  Let be a coherent -module  We denote by the coherent -module corresponding to  We call this the   naive Fourier transform  of  Then Noot-Huyghe showed in that there exists a canonical isomorphism We often denote by to mean  For simplicity  we will often omit the index in the notation or   functors naive  global  Fourier transform  | 

 Standard properties of -adic geometric Fourier transform explained in hold also for -adic Fourier transform with suitable changes  Since the proof works well with little change  we leave the reader to formulate and verify these properties  Although the most of these properties are not used in this paper  we still need a few analogous results  We will write the statements of these results with short comments of the proofs        Let be a coherent - -module    i e    a finite dimensional - -vector space   Then  we have a canonical isomorphism  m sF  q   V   cong i  0    V  1   where denotes the structural morphisms  and is the closed immersion defined by in  When is trivial  another calculation for this Fourier transform was carried out by Baldassarri and Berthelot in BB  In their calculation  there are no Tate twist contrary to our calculation here  This is because the definitions of the Frobenius structures on the geometric Fourier transform are slightly different  For the precise argument  see

 Let be the dual geometric Fourier transform  the functor defined in the same way as except for reversing the role of and  We get the following inversion formula        Let be a coherent - -module  Then  there exists a functorial isomorphism  m sF   circ m sF   m sM   2  cong m sM  1   We may also prove the theorem in more general cases  let be a smooth formal scheme over and let be a locally free sheaf of finite rank on  Consider the projective bundle to define the geometric Fourier transform  cf    Then the theorem is reformulated as  Let be the divisor at infinity of  For the proof  we need to show that there exists an isomorphism  This can be seen from and

 Let  We define a convergent -isocrystal on overconvergent along in the following way  As an -module  it is isomorphic to  We denote the global section corresponding to by  We define its connection by  nabla e    alpha x  -1   cdot e otimes dx  The Frobenius structure is defined by  Phi 1 otimes e   x   alpha q-1   cdot e  We often use the same notation for the underlying coherent -module  This is called the   Kummer isocrystal    Fi  -isocrystal  overconvergent isocrystal  Kummer s        Let be the canonical morphism of couples  Assume  Then we get that the canonical homomorphism j  j   m sK   alpha arrow m sK   alpha is an isomorphism  Moreover  let be the following -vector space with Frobenius structure  G  alpha  pi   H 1   mr rig    m bA  k 1 setminus 0   m sK    alpha otimes m sL   pi    Fi  -isocrystal  overconvergent isocrystal    Then  we have  m sF   pi  m sK   alpha  1  cong m sK   1- alpha  otimes G  alpha  pi  1   The first statement follows from Lemma calcofdiff  For the latter claim  the proof works essentially the same as in Lau by replacing by and using the K   u nneth formula kunnethformual  The Tate twist appearing here comes from the isomorphism  rigDmodpush
Stationary Phase
 In this section  we will prove the stationary phase formula when the differential slope at infinity is less than or equal to  However  in this section  we do not consider Frobenius structures on the local Fourier transforms  so the stationary phase in this section is still temporary  This will be completed in the next section  Throughout this section  we continuously use the assumptions and notation of paragraph setupFour

 We keep using notation of F cent and FrobE  Let be integers  We will first define a homomorphism compatible with and  Let be either or considered as a subgroup of  For non-negative integers we consider as a subring of or using the canonical inclusions  Then we claim that where is or and  For the claim is nothing but the compatibility of and  Let us see the claim for  By definition  we get for large enough integer and thus holds for any positive integer  By a standard continuity argument  we get the claim  Since is equal to in we get the desired homomorphism  Now we get the following  The canonical homomorphism is an isomorphism  Since is locally projective over the canonical homomorphism  Ecom pm   fr m    fr   m sX   otimes   Dcomp m  fr   m sX    F   Dcom pm   m sX    arrow Ecom pm   fr   m sX    otimes   Dcomp m  fr   m sX   F   Dcom pm   m sX     xrightarro w sim F   Ecomp Qm    m sX    is injective  Thus we get the injectivity of  intfrobisod  Let us see the surjectivity  Since it suffices to show that the image of  intfrobisod  contains  This follows from the fact that and the surjectivity of the homomorphism  Let be a coherent -module  Then there exists a canonical isomorphism  Edag Q ms X   otimes F   m sM  arrow F    Edag Q ms X     otimes m sM    Since tensor product is right exact and is exact  it suffices to prove the lemma for by the coherence of  Since inductive limit commutes with tensor product  it suffices to see that the homomorphism is an isomorphism  Since is locally projective over this claim follows from Lemma canhomm m  above by taking the inverse limit over and we conclude the proof  The construction does not depend on the choice of and and Lemma EcommFrob holds for any smooth formal curve  Since is determined uniquely when is determined  it suffices to see that the construction only depends on  This verification is left to the reader

 We use the notation of paragraph setupFour  Let be a holonomic - -module  Let us define an LF-topology on  Let be the canonical extension of at  By Corollary ananddag we know that  m sE    mr an   otimes  M  cong E  ag   Aone  mb Q    otimes m sM  Let be a stable coherent -module such that  For since is a Fr√©chet-Stein algebra  any finitely presented module becomes a Fr√©chet space  By taking to be sufficiently large  we may suppose that is finite free over by Corollary coinccrew  There exist two topologies on   the Fr√©chet topology induced from -module structure denoted by and topology induced from the finite free -module structure denoted by  Since becomes a topological -module as well  we get that and are equivalent by the open mapping theorem  Now  we put on the inductive limit topology  By the observation above  the inductive limit topology coincides with the -module topology  cf   Lemma fieldconstmicdif  Since is an LF-space and the module is finite free over we get that the inductive limit-topology is separated and becomes an LF-space  Thus this defines an LF-space structure on  By using Remark anyelem  ii   we note here that this is also a topological -module  Thus  if is finite over this LF-space topology coincides with the -module topology by the open mapping theorem  Recall the notation of   normalfontdefvanishcycle    Assume that is a   holonomic  - -module  Then there exists a canonical isomorphism  Phi  m sM |  S 0   xrightarro w sim  Phi  mu  m sM     Let be a holonomic - -module such that is also a holonomic - -module  First  we will show that  Let  alpha colon  M  arrow m sE    mr an   otimes    ms D    mr an     M   qquad  beta colon m sE    mr an   otimes   ms D    mr an     M  arrow  M   be the homomorphisms mapping and respectively  Obviously  we get  It suffices to show that is surjective  Let and be the canonical extensions of and respectively  By Corollary ananddag we get  M  con gE   ag   Aone  mb Q   otimes m sN  0  qquad  m sE    mr an   otimes  M  con gE   ag   Aone  mb Q    otimes m sM  0  Using paragraph LFspacetoppartcase we endow these with the LF-space topologies  or equivalently the -module topologies   Since these are equipped with -module topologies and is -linear  is continuous with these topologies  cf    To see the surjectivity of it suffices to show that it is a homomorphism of -modules  Since is invertible in we get that  This shows that is linear with respect to the subring generated by and  Note that is dense in  Since the target of is an LF-space  it is separated  and we get the claim  Now  since the category - is abelian by we define the - -modules by the following exact sequence of - -modules  0 arrow m cK  arrow m sM |  S 0  arrow mu  m sM   arrow m cC  arrow 0  Here the middle homomorphism is induced by the scalar extension of the identity map on  By the definition of Frobenius structures  cf   dfnfrobmu   this homomorphism is a homomorphism of modules with Frobenius structures  Take and we get an exact sequence by Remark locFordfnrem and the claim above  0 arrow m sE    mr an   otimes m cK  arrow mu  m sM   arrow mu  m sM   arrow m sE    mr an   otimes m cC  arrow 0  This shows that  Let be a holonomic - -module such that  Let be the canonical extension of we have  Edag Q0  otimes  N    mr can   cong m sE    mr an    otimes  N  0  This shows that there are no singularities for at so that is a convergent isocrystal around  In particular  we get an isomorphism of differential modules for some integer  note that in the isomorphism  we are forgetting the Frobenius structures   Applying this observation to and we get that these are direct sums of trivial modules  Since and the functor is exact  we finish the proof 

 Let be a holonomic  -  -module  We define  When possesses a Frobenius structure  this is a -vector space with Frobenius structure  There exists a canonical homomorphism This homomorphism is injective  and compatible with Frobenius structures if they exist  When this injection is an isomorphism  is said to be   unramified at infinity   This is equivalent to saying that is a trivial differential module  Let be a holonomic - -module unramified at infinity  Then the linebreak - -module is holonomic  Since depends only on and the claim does not depend on the Frobenius structure by Lemma characterisation of Dan hol mod we may suppose that is isomorphic to where  In this case  we know that is equal to by Proposition calcfouriereasy  Now  and we may check directly that is generated over by  Thus the claim follows using Lemma characterisation of Dan hol mod once again  Let be a holonomic - -module which is unramified at infinity  Then we have  Phi  n F ms M  |  S  0      K   mr ur   otimes K  m sM |  s  infty   1   By Lemma conccalclocfouunr we get that is finite over  Thus by Lemma reductiontomu it suffices to calculate  Since depends only on we may assume that  Indeed  its -module around is isomorphic to as differential -modules with Frobenius structures using the isomorphism  solisom  In this case  we may use Proposition calcfouriereasy to get that  n F ms M   cong i  0     m sM |  s  infty   1   Now  using Proposition reductiontomu again  it suffices to calculate which is nothing but what we stated  and concludes the proof  We believe that is a holonomic - -module even when is not unramified at infinity  and is closely related to the local Fourier transform of Laumon  However  we do not need this generality in this paper  and we do not go into this problem further  Let be a holonomic - -module which is an overconvergent isocrystal on a dense open subscheme of and assume that it is unramified at infinity  We denote by the canonical morphism of couples  Then there exists the following exact sequence of Deligne modules  Here  by abuse of language  we denoted by and using the cohomological functors of   normalfontdefpullbackpush    By  vanishexact   there is the following exact sequence  0 	 arrow m rHom    ms D   ag   m bD  nFn p ms M   |  S  0      m cO   K  mr ur     mr an    arrow m bV   m bD   nFn p ms M   |  S  0     arrow m bW   m bD  nFn p ms M   |  S  0     arrow

Interlude on scalar extensions
 In this subsection  we recall a formal way to extend scalars  cf    in a general Tannakian category  with the intention of use in  Sproof geo mod  Most of the proofs are formal and they are only sketched  To shorten the exposition  we may implicitly assume that the objects of our categories have elements  so that they are -vector spaces endowed with some extra structures  For a general treatment  confer to   loc   cit   In this subsection the field is only assumed to be perfect  whereas in the rest of  Ssection7 it is finite  Let be a Tannakian category over  Assume that the objects of have finite length  Let be a field extension of and an object of  A -structure on is a homomorphism  Lambda  -structure  of -algebras  Let  resp    be a -structure on  resp    A morphism in is said to be compatible with the -structures if for every in we have  The couples where is a -structure on an object in form a category  whose morphisms are the morphisms in compatible with the -structures  We denote this category by  Sometimes  we denote simply by an object in

 We define an internal tensor product in as follows  Let and be two objects in  Since has finite length  there exists a smallest sub-object such that  for all in the image of factors through  We put  There are two natural -structures on given respectively by the endomorphisms and  By construction they induce the same -structure on  The couple defines an object of denoted by  It satisfies the usual universal property of the tensor product in the category which makes a Tannakian category  Let be a non-empty open subscheme of a proper curve a geometric point of  The category of representations with local finite geometric mo -no -dromy is equivalent  and even isomorphic  to as Tannakian category  Let be a field as in susubsection k finite and be a finite Galois extension  By construction  the category of overconvergent isocrystals with -structure is equivalent  as Tannakian category  to  Now assume to be a finite field with elements and that the order of the Frobenius is so that  If is totally ramified  then is equivalent to as Tannakian category  where  If is not totally ramified  an overconvergent -isocrystal with -structure on over can be identified with an overconvergent isocrystal on endowed with a   Frobenius   which is -linear although only of order

Proof for finite geometric monodromy
 The goal of this subsection is to prove the product formula in the case of overconvergent -isocrystals with geometrically finite mo -no -dromy  in particular for -isocrystals which are canonical extensions  see Proposition PF fgm and Corollary cor cong Fiso spec  Although the proof for overconvergent -isocrystals with finite mo -no -dromy is analogous to that of and it is given in there are some technical difficulties to show that for   geometrically  finite case  and we treat this case by using the formal scalar extension reviewed in the previous subsection 
 In subsubsec loc const Ctf  and ss glob const Ctf  we define local and global   constants   for generalized isocrystals in  They will be seen as elements of the -algebra of functions  To avoid any confusion with constant functions  we employ the term factors instead of   constants    For simplicity  we will often assume that the order of Frobenius is so that and cf   susubsection k finite   we might state the definitions and prove the lemmas in the general case  but this is not needed for proving Proposition PF fgm

 Assume and so  Let be a non-empty open subscheme of and an overconvergent -isocrystal on over  For any finite Galois extension we can define an overconvergent -isocrystal with -structure  cf   scalar ext  The -isocrystal satisfies the product formula   normalfont  PF-iso   if and only if satisfies the product formula with -structure   normalfont  eq gen PF scalar ext    For an abelian category we denote by its Grothendieck group  In this proof we put  The formula  PF-iso   resp    eq gen PF scalar ext   is a relation on the Grothendieck group of  resp    with values in  resp   in the group of units of the -algebra  Each factors appearing in the equality  PF-iso   resp    eq gen PF scalar ext   are homomorphisms  resp    By the definitions of these factors  cf    subsubsec loc const Ctf  --ss glob const Ctf    it follows the commutativity of the diagram  xymatri x  Gr  mc A   ar r   - nu  ar d   - Ctf  otimes   Ct  -  	  bCt   ar d
