The issue of associativity  continued versus iterated compositions
  associativity of function compositions  The superficially similar iterated composition  iterated compositions  where the order of operations proceeds from right to left  is sometimes confused with  eqre fE ccomp   particularly in the case where the are identical  that is  when for all In such a case  the approximants and so on  can be viewed either as continued or as iterated compositions  Denoting an iterated composition s th iterate by   u n c  t n circ t  n-1  circ cdots t 2 circ t 1 circ t 0 c       one has the forward recurrence relation  recurrence relation    u n c  t n circ u  n-1  c       but note that  in general  this does not generate a continued composition  Indeed  using the abbreviation    K j n t  j  circ t  j 1  circ cdots circ t n c       one has the backward recurrence relation  recurrence relation     K j n t j circ K  j 1   n     Up until 1911  most examples of continued nonlinear function compositions  Here we consider   continued linear functions  to include continued fractions  continued fractions    were actually iterated compositions of the form  eqre fE fixpoint   constructed using the method of successive substitution   successive substitution  In this procedure  one attempts to solve an equation of the form by repeatedly substituting for the argument of   x	 t t x     
 x	 t t t x      
 x	 t t t t x        and so on  which amounts to an algorithm for computing a fixed point of  The conditions on under which this algorithm would converge began to be rigorously addressed in the second half of the 19th century  we cite only a few of the many papers on forward iteration from this period  Ramanujan s continued square root identities from 1911 appear to be the first published examples of continued compositions  eqre fE ccomp  in which the are nonlinear and not identical   ppl  Ramanujan  Srinivasa   continued square roots Ramanujan s
Terminology
 To name the expression the works cited and quoted here have employed nearly every possible concatenation of one or more words from the set continued  infinite  nested  iterated with a word from the set root  radical  power  However  the text not directly quoted from primary sources attempts to follow two guidelines in naming function compositions  em Adjectives should be specific about the associativity of the expression  Thus  as discussed in Section S assoc continued as a modifier of a named function composition indicates formation by a backward recurrence relation  while iterated indicates a forward recurrence relation  recurrence relation   On the other hand  the adjectives nested and infinite are ambiguous with regard to associativity  em Nouns should refer to functions rather than symbols  Thus we prefer continued square root and continued th root to the less specific continued radical

 the note is a letter to an editor who more or less goaded Rudio to provide such a proof  In 1890  in the journal p hVierteljahrsschrift der Naturforschenden Gesellschaft in Z   u rich  35 Rudio published a long article on the history of the circle quadrature problem  Mentioning  the reciprocal of  Vi   e te s formula for he added a footnote quoting the infinite product of secants  infinite products of secant functions  from s cEuler 1783   ppl  Euler  Leonhard    In the footnote on page 17 of his 1890 quadrature paper  Rudio expresses doubt that Euler was aware of Vi   e te s formula   The following year  in p hZeitschrift f   u r Mathematik und Physik  historisch-literarische Abteilung  36 editor Moritz Cantor reviewed Rudio s article  Cantor pointed out that a rigorous investigation of convergence had not yet been done for Vi   e te s formula  and suggested that Rudio should have done so  Rudio s page-and-a-half response to Cantor uses the cosine half-angle formula to replace the secants in Euler s infinite product with finite continued square roots  and carefully establishes the convergence of the resulting expansion  em  1894a  W  Heymann  ppl  Heymann  W

convergence of continued operations with monotonic functions in particular the family of functions   continued compositions of functions   Besides numerous convergence results we obtain a complete

study of the general nonautonomous difference equation of first order    x  n 1  F n x n   quad n in mathb bN       This happens in the third chapter  the heart of this work   In order to get on the track of the asymptotic behavior of solutions of the equation  we examine first the limiting set of such a solution  Now the special case of an autonomous equation  difference equations autonomous    x  n 1  F x n   quad n in mathb bN     admits of three invariance characteristics of limiting sets  which permit a more exact localization We can transfer these in an appropriate way to the general equation Here we find our way using the corresponding approach from the theory of ordinary differential equations  differential equations    The transfer makes it necessary to define limit functions for the function  The totality of these we call the limiting set  It is true that the formulation of the invariance results must be restricted to limit equations formed by limit functions  but nevertheless a beautiful structure develops  analogous to the limiting set of the solution sequence --- the limiting set of the function  This becomes more transparent if we use various facts from the theory of dynamical systems and results of the Ukrainian mathematician Sarkovskii  ppl  Sharkovskii  O  M     In the fourth chapter we translate results about continued operations into the language of chapter 3 We explain how one can interpret the formation of a continued operation as a generalization of a summation procedure for linear difference equations    T he theory of the third chapter presupposes to a large extent so-called compactness characteristics of the function and the solution  This makes more difficult the parallel development of this theory with the difference equations of the continued operations  because the interesting cases of the continued operations  continued compositions arbitrary positive real-valued  are usually those which lead to unbounded solutions and non-compact functions  But the remarks of the fourth chapter point also to a possible way out  namely stability analyses of the solutions    The appendix consists of two parts  A supremely strange

function can be chosen so that the expansions of prescribed real numbers can have essentially any desired behavior  The following results  listed in roughly increasing order of unlikeliness  are representative of what we can prove     Theorem 1  For any two real numbers there exists a function such that the -expansion of is the same as the usual continued fraction expansion of     Theorem 2  There exists a function such that the -expansion of any rational or quadratic irrational terminates     Theorem 3  There exists a function such that the -expansion of a real number is periodic if and only if is a cubic irrational number     Theorem 4  There exists a function such that  simultaneously for every integer a real number is algebraic of degree if and only if the -expansion of terminates with the integer     W e should confess what the reader might already suspect  that the functions giving the nice behaviors of Theorems 1--4 are infeasible for actual computations  Indeed  the existence of such functions is essentially a consequence of the existence of continuous functions on the interval with certain properties   This confession notwithstanding  the paper concludes with

optimized   nested exponentials  continued exponentials   nested roots  iterated roots  and factor approximants   In the present Letter  we advance a novel type of self-similar approximants that may be called self-similar continued radical approximants or  for short  self-similar continued radicals  In a particular case  these continued radicals reduce to continued fractions  continued fractions  and  respectively  to Pad√© approximants  approximants Pad√©  Pad√© approximants   But  generally  their form is different and not reduceable  sic  to continued fractions  The self-similar continued radicals could be transformed into expressions of the type of the numerical nested radicals which  however  is not convenient for the extrapolation procedure applied to functions    In Section 2  we explain how the self-similar continued radicals arise in the process of the self-similar renormalization  renormalization  of asymptotic series and prove the convergence of these root approximants  In Section 3  we demonstrate  by several examples from condensed-matter physics  condensed-matter physics   that the continued radicals  continued th roots   continued robb roots continued th roots
